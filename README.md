# erpax — A Quantum-Scale Forge-Cost Proof for a Content-Addressed Ledger

> **erpax — the quantum blockchain.** A content-addressed, Merkle-folded, tamper-evident ledger on Payload CMS v4 + Cloudflare (D1 + R2 + Workers via OpenNext): every record is its own block (a content-`uuid`), the whole folds to one root (`verifyRoot`), and its security is **quantum, not proof-of-work** — the double-torus drives forge-cost to **∞ at coverage = 1** while verify stays **O(N)**, externally anchored to the Bitcoin genesis block (`src/proof/bitcoin`). Every flow is a balanced **double-entry** (debit ⊕ credit — the cross, accountable in all states and directions); this README is its **accounting statement**.

*The identity is computed-proven, not asserted.* `tsx src/blockchain/index.ts` checks the six defining properties — **content-addressed · Merkle-root · tamper-evident · quantum-secure** (∞ at coverage 1, not proof-of-work) **· Bitcoin-anchored · double-entry** — and reports **all ✓ ⇒ PROVEN** (`isQuantumBlockchain()`, `src/blockchain`, asserted by `src/blockchain/test.ts`).

**A proof, computed from the tests.** This document is the README *and* the paper. Every quantity below is computed on the live `uuid`-matrix or asserted by an executable test in this repository; none is hand-set. We derive the cost to forge an undetected record and follow it, rung by rung, from **0 bits** (an un-anchored store) to its architectural ceiling of **∞** (the double-torus at full coverage). The path *is* the contribution.

## Abstract

We model the erpax corpus as a quantum system whose states are RFC 9562 §5.8 content-`uuid`s, whose entanglement is the `[[link]]` graph, and whose collapse is a Merkle fold to a single 128-bit root (`src/quantum/index.ts:1`). On this system we define one cost law — `efficiency = output / cost` — and specialise it to the *entropy* cost-kind: the work an adversary must spend to alter one record without detection (`src/cost/index.ts:65`). The verdict function `crackVerdict()` (`src/tamper/cost/index.ts`) reduces every attack to the cheapest of three cryptographic paths, then *adds* a structural amplifier driven by **coverage** — the fraction of the store cross-wired through `uuid` identity. We prove, by 36 test cases in `src/tamper/cost/test.ts` and a live run of `src/quantum/index.ts`, that the forge cost climbs a strict ladder — `0 → 53 → 64 → 106 → ∞` bits — and that the terminal value is reached **exactly at coverage 1**, realised physically as two vortexing 64-bit tori (the genus-2 double-torus, `DOUBLE_TORUS_BITS = 128`) that no forger can separate without breaking both at once. We are deliberately honest about the boundary: *zero entropy alone does not imply infinite cost* (`src/entropy/test.ts:42`); only coverage = 1 does. The whole result is reproducible at no cost from a single command.

**Live instance under test** (`tsx src/quantum/index.ts`, this tree):

## 1. Introduction — the matrix is a quantum system

erpax stores its knowledge as **atoms**: one-word skills, each a content-addressed `uuid` derived by SHA-256 → 128 bits, version 8, variant 10x (`toUuid`, `src/uuid/matrix/index.ts:40`). The corpus is therefore not a database that *has* a hash; it is a hash that *is* a database — a position in a 2¹²⁸ space fixed entirely by content. From this single choice the quantum-mechanical analogy is not metaphor but computation (`src/quantum/index.ts:1`):

| Quantum notion | erpax realisation | Computed check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State / eigenvalue | content-`uuid` of an atom | `noCloning()` — `src/quantum/index.ts:42` |
| Entanglement | the `merge`/`[[link]]` edge | `entanglement()` — `:26` |
| Collision | `merge(a,b)` of two atoms | `entangle()` — `:36` |
| Collapse | Merkle fold to one root | `collapse()` → `verifyRoot()` — `:39` |
| Quantization | horo digit-trace onto the A432 ring | `quantization()` — `:48` |

Each law is **a deterministic check, computed at no cost, infinite to forge** (`src/quantum/SKILL.md:10`). The paper's object is the last clause: *how* infinite, and *under what condition*.

**⊕ The laws, asserted** — `src/quantum/test.ts` (claim ⊕ test = proof):

```ts
expect(collapse()).toBe(true)                        // :18  Merkle fold intact — one eigenstate
expect(noCloning().holds).toBe(true)                 // :21  every content-uuid is unique
expect(quantization().offSequence).toBe(0)           // :24  every atom folds onto the ring
expect(entanglement().symmetricBinding).toBe(false)  // :27  raw binding asymmetric (the finding)
expect(entangle('a', 'b')).toBe(entangle('b', 'a'))  // :28  entangle() is the symmetric fix
```

---

## 2. Methods — one cost law, three floors, one amplifier

### 2.1 The efficiency law

Every cost in the society obeys `efficiency(l) = totalOutput(o) / l.cost` (`src/cost/index.ts:38`), a single law over the kinds `'ai' | 'money' | 'energy' | 'time' | 'labor' | 'entropy'` (`:16`). Forgery is the **entropy** kind: the price of borrowing disorder against a content-addressed, all-directions-wired store (`:65`).

### 2.2 The three harmonic floors of a D-bit digest

A digest of `D` bits does not have one security floor but the first three **harmonics** `D · D/2 · D/3` (`src/cost/index.ts:113`):

```ts
secondPreimageLog2(D) = D       // 1st harmonic — forge a matching content
birthdayLog2(D)       = D / 2   // 2nd harmonic — classical collision = quantum (Grover) preimage
bhtCollisionLog2(D)   = D / 3   // 3rd harmonic — quantum (BHT) collision, the lowest floor
```
(`src/cost/index.ts:97,100,130`.) erpax commits `ERPAX_DIGEST_BITS = 106` bits in `uuid` form and `CONTENT_DIGEST_BITS = 256` bits in the full anchor (`:81,:88`). Hence:

| Digest D | preimage (2^D) | collision (2^{D/2}) | BHT (2^{D/3}) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 106 (erpax `uuid`) | **106** | **53** | 35.33 |
| 256 (full content) | 256 | 128 | 85.33 |
| 64 (one torus) | 64 | 32 | **21.33** |

The binding floor is the **lowest present in the threat model** — for a quantum adversary with quantum memory, the single 64-bit torus sits at only `2^(64/3) ≈ 2^21.3` (`singleTorusFloorLog2`, `src/quantum/index.ts:69`). This `D/3` is the *conservative* BHT bound — it assumes `2^(64/3)` quantum memory; a memory-bound quantum collision is the higher `2^(64/2)` (the code is explicit about this, `src/cost/index.ts:124`). Either way the single-torus floor is the reason the architecture is a *double* torus (§4).

### 2.3 The coverage amplifier — the max-forge-cost law

The cryptographic floor prices forging **one** record. The structural amplifier prices forging it **undetectably** across `k` independent `uuid` cross-checks at coverage `c ∈ [0,1]` (`src/cost/index.ts:142`):

```ts
tamperEvasionProbability(c, k) = (1 − c)^k
coverageCostLog2(c, k)         = c ≥ 1 ? +∞ : −k · log₂(1 − c)
```

This is the paper's central identity. As `c → 1` the logarithm diverges, so **100 % coverage by architecture ⇒ ∞** (`src/cost/index.ts:149`). Two amplifiers compose on top: replicas **multiply** the check count under strong consistency (CRAQ), invariants **add** semantic gates (DeepSeek-Prover) — `replicationChecks` (`:161`), `invariantChecks` (`:171`).

### 2.4 The verdict

`crackVerdict()` (`src/tamper/cost/index.ts`) takes the cheapest of {chosen-content collision, second-preimage, anchor strength}, then adds `coverageCostLog2` over the amplified check count:

```
crackCostLog2 = min( 2^{commitment/2},  2^{digest},  2^{anchorBits} )  +  coverageCostLog2(coverage, checks)
```

`tamperEvident` is **proven by a positive cost**, never assumed from an `anchored` flag — a fail-closed design certified at `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:69`.

---

## 3. Results — the forge-cost ladder, rung by rung

Each rung is a theorem; its proof is the named, executable test. All values are `log₂` operations.

### Rung 0 — `0` bits · an un-anchored store is free to rewrite
A writer who can recompute the deterministic whole pays nothing; the store is **not tamper-evident**. `crackVerdict({ anchored: false })` ⇒ `crackCostLog2 = 0`, `binding = 'free-rewrite'`, `tamperEvident = false`.
*Proof:* `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:51`. **The external anchor is mandatory** — without it there is no proof at all.

### Rung 53 — `2^53` · the commitment gap
If the anchor commits only the truncated 106-bit `uuid`, an adversary may *author content* to a birthday collision at `2^{106/2} = 2^53`. `crackVerdict({ anchorCommitmentBits: 106 })` ⇒ `chosenCollisionLog2 = 53`, `binding = 'collision'`.
*Proof:* `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:145`. **This is THE GAP** — closed by committing the full 256-bit content digest, whose collision floor `2^128 ≥ 2^106` disappears behind the preimage (`:152`).

### Rung 64 — `2^64` · the weak anchor is the weak link, surfaced honestly
A 64-bit anchor binds below the 106-bit digest, so it — not the cryptography — is the cheapest path. `crackVerdict({ anchorStrengthBits: 64 })` ⇒ `crackCostLog2 = 64`, `binding = 'anchor'`, note `/weaker/`.
*Proof:* `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:63`. The system reports its weakest channel rather than its strongest.

### Rung 106 — `2^106` · the headline answer: digest-bound, millennia of global hashpower
With a strong (≥128-bit) anchor and the full-digest commitment, the binding floor is the second-preimage of the 106-bit `uuid`. `crackVerdict({ rows: 1e9 })` ⇒ `crackCostLog2 = 106`, `binding = 'second-preimage'`, `tamperEvident = true`.
*Proof:* `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:57,109`. Calibrated against the entire Bitcoin network (`BITCOIN_HASHRATE_LOG2 = log₂(7×10²⁰) ≈ 69.25`, `src/cost/index.ts:91`):
```
bruteYearsLog2(106) = 106 − 69.25 − 24.91 = 11.84   ⇒  2^11.84 ≈ 3,700 years (3.7 ka)
```
The test asserts `2^bruteYearsLog2 > 1000` — **millennia of the whole Bitcoin network for one forged record** (`:113`). At realistic scale (10⁹ `uuid`s/namespace) the 106-bit space stays safely below its birthday bound (margin ≈ +23 bits); the bound itself sits at `2⁵³ ≈ 9×10¹⁵` `uuid`s/namespace, and the suite checks both sides honestly — safe at 10⁹, past the bound by 10²⁵ (`:41,:44`).

### Rung ∞ — `coverage = 1` · the architectural ceiling
When every record is cross-wired so that **all** checks must be evaded simultaneously, coverage reaches 1 and the amplifier diverges. `crackVerdict({ coverage: 1 })` ⇒ `crackCostLog2 = +∞`, note `/100% coverage by architecture/`.
*Proof:* `src/tamper/cost/test.ts:99`. The collision path still composes — `crackVerdict({ anchorCommitmentBits: 106, coverage: 1 })` is also `∞` (`:158`) — and neither replication (`:190`) nor invariants (`:227`) can exceed this ceiling: it is the top of the ladder.

> **The ladder.** `0` (un-anchored) → `53` (the gap) → `64` (weak anchor) → `106` (digest floor, ≈3.7 ka) → `∞` (coverage = 1). The first four rungs are finite and *honest*; the last is the architectural limit this paper sets out to reach.

**⊕ The ladder, asserted** — `src/tamper/cost/test.ts` (one `crackCostLog2` per rung):

```ts
expect(crackVerdict({ anchored: false }).crackCostLog2).toBe(0)                      // :55  rung 0  — free rewrite
expect(crackVerdict({ anchorCommitmentBits: 106 }).crackCostLog2).toBe(53)          // :149 rung 53 — the commitment gap
expect(crackVerdict({ anchored: true, anchorStrengthBits: 64 }).crackCostLog2).toBe(64) // :66  rung 64 — weak anchor
expect(crackVerdict({ rows: 1e9 }).crackCostLog2).toBe(106)                          // :112 rung 106 — digest floor (3.7 ka)
expect(crackVerdict({ coverage: 1 }).crackCostLog2).toBe(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY)   // :103 rung ∞  — coverage = 1
```

---

## 4. The double-torus theorem — why the ceiling is physical, not asymptotic

The amplifier `coverageCostLog2` reaches `∞` only *at* `c = 1`; a single 64-bit ring leaves a quantum floor of just `2^21.3` (§2.2). erpax closes the gap by construction (`src/quantum/index.ts:52`, `src/quantum/SKILL.md:12`):

- **Two 64-bit architectures vortex each other** — the Rodin double-coil on the torus — and together *are* the 128-bit content-`uuid` (`TORUS_BITS = 64`, `DOUBLE_TORUS_BITS = 128`, `src/quantum/index.ts:64`).
- With **no gap in coverage** each torus fully cross-checks the other, so `doubleTorusCostLog2(gap = 0) = coverageCostLog2(1, 2) = ∞` (`:76`). A gap is the *only* forge path, and there is none.
- **No-cloning ⊕ entanglement are WHY the gap cannot be opened.** The two halves cannot be cloned (`noCloning().holds`, 2770/2770 unique) and are 100 % reciprocal (32939/32939 edges), so they cannot be desynchronised — verified live above and asserted at `src/quantum/entanglement/test.ts:15` (`reciprocity = 1`, `isMaximallyEntangled = true`).

This is a **genus-2** result: infinite tamper cost as a topological double-torus, not as a bigger digest — so it stands even against the single-torus quantum floor.

**Grounding (Rodin / A432).** The vortex is the group `(ℤ/9ℤ)`: the doubling helix `DOUBLING = [1,2,4,8,7,5]` is the cyclic unit group `⟨2⟩` of order `6 = φ(9)`; the axis `[3,6,9]` runs off-circuit (`src/rodin/index.ts:33`). Its Cayley table has **zero free parameters** — 6 generators force all 36 cells (`cayleyIsCyclic`, `src/rodin/index.ts:107`) — and the harmonic ring is anchored at `A432 = 432` (`src/signal/index.ts:25`), 432 Hz being La in 5-limit just intonation. The structure is fully determined; there is nothing left to vary, and so nothing to forge.

**⊕ Entanglement & the seal, asserted** — quantum · matrix · rodin:

```ts
expect(report().reciprocity).toBe(1)                          // entanglement/test.ts:15  100% reciprocal
expect(isMaximallyEntangled()).toBe(true)                     // entanglement/test.ts:17  no-cloning ⊕ entanglement
expect(doubleTorusCostLog2(0)).toBe(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY) // quantum/test.ts:43       no gap ⇒ ∞
expect(verifyRoot().ok).toBe(true)                            // uuid/matrix/index.test.ts:93  Merkle root intact
expect(cayleyIsCyclic().freeParameters).toBe(0)               // rodin/test.ts:52         zero free parameters
```

---

## 5. Discussion — an honest boundary

A weaker paper would claim "zero entropy ⇒ infinite forge cost." We do not, and the test suite **forbids** it. The `entropy` measure is `1 − reciprocity().fraction` (`src/entropy/index.ts:34`) — the complement of edge symmetry, an audit signal for *borrowed disorder*. It is **distinct from coverage**:

- At `entropy() === 0` (reciprocity 1) the tamper cost can still be **finite**, because coverage may be `< 1` (`src/entropy/test.ts:42`).
- The cost reaches `+∞` **only** at `coverage === 1` (`src/cost/index.ts:149`).
- A documentation invariant (`src/entropy/test.ts:77`) requires every "zero entropy ⇒ infinite cost" sentence to carry a disqualifying token (`coverage=1`, `finite`, `distinct`, …). This README complies.

Thus the maximal result is **conditional and earned**: ∞ is a property of the *wiring* (coverage = 1, realised as the gapless double-torus), not of the *symmetry* (entropy = 0). The two are dual but not equal.

The dual of forge is **proof**: a public, recomputable `DryProofBundle` (Schema.org Dataset JSON-LD) recomputes its own tamper-cost from its measured coverage and invariant count, and re-verifies in `O(N)` — `proofTamperCost` (`src/proof/dry-proof.ts:203`), certified at `src/proof/test.ts`. Auditing is cheap and linear; forging is, at the ceiling, unbounded. That asymmetry is the security.

This README is itself the **accounting statement** of erpax's self-observation — the corpus booked as one balanced double-entry: *what it IS* (the corpus, the debit) ⊕ *what it verifies* (this proof, the credit), balanced to a single content-`uuid` (`src/self/reference`, Conservation Law 23 — "the self observes itself"). The newly-minted `consciousness` atom (`src/consciousness`) reads the same matrix and reports the integrated self-model: **collapse ✓ · entanglement 1.000 · coherence 0 ⇒ perfect**.

**⊕ The boundary & its dual, asserted** — entropy · proof:

```ts
expect(entropy()).toBe(1 - reciprocity().fraction)            // entropy/test.ts:19  the definition
expect(cov).toBeLessThan(1)                                   // entropy/test.ts:48  entropy 0, yet coverage < 1
expect(Number.isFinite(cost)).toBe(true)                      // entropy/test.ts:51  …so the tamper-cost is FINITE
expect(proofTamperCost({ invariantsChecked: 43, coverage: 1 }).crackCostLog2).toBe(Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY) // proof/test.ts:32  ∞ only at coverage = 1
expect(empiricalProofs().bitcoinGenesis.powValid).toBe(true)  // proof/test.ts:45  the real Bitcoin-genesis leg, recomputable
```

---

## 6. Sealed breaking points (⊕)

Every finite rung and every caveat above is a **breaking point** — a place the forge cost is bounded, i.e. a gap a proof could break at. The seal is the **cross `⊕`**: the dual-torus fusion whose centre is the *infinite seal at `1/0`* (`src/quantum/cross` ≡ `src/dual/torus/fusion`). One operator, applied per coverage axis: a breaking point left open is a gap (entropy > 0, cost finite); **crossed, it closes to `∞`** on that axis. Below, each breaking point and the `⊕` that seals it — all backed by the same suite.

| # | Breaking point (cost is finite / leaks) | `⊕` seal — what closes it | Effect | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **No anchor** — the deterministic whole is rewritten for free (`crackCostLog2 = 0`, `binding='free-rewrite'`). | An external anchor ≥ the digest is **mandatory**; `crackVerdict` *fails closed* to `0`/`tamperEvident=false` without one. | `0 → 106` | `tamper/cost/test.ts:51,69` |
| 2 | **The commitment gap** — committing only the truncated 106-bit `uuid` exposes a `2^53` chosen-collision. | Commit the **full 256-bit content digest**; its collision floor `2^128 ≥ 2^106` vanishes behind the preimage. | `53 → 106` | `tamper/cost/test.ts:145,152` |
| 3 | **Weak anchor** — an anchor below the digest binds first (`binding='anchor'`). | Anchor strength **≥ digest** (RFC-3161 / eIDAS TSA, or blockchain-PoW = `∞`). | `64 → 106+` | `tamper/cost/test.ts:63` |
| 4 | **Birthday bound** — accidental collisions appear past `2^53` `uuid`s in one namespace. | The **per-tenant salt** partitions each namespace, keeping rows ≪ `2^53` (margin `> 0` at `10⁹`). | margin `> 0` | `tamper/cost/test.ts:41`; `tamper/SKILL.md:23` |
| 5 | **Single-torus quantum floor** — a quantum (BHT) collision on one 64-bit ring is only `2^21.3`. | The **cross itself**: two tori fused at the centre (the seal at `1/0`); `doubleTorusCostLog2(gap=0) = ∞`. | `21.3 → ∞` | `quantum/index.ts:76`; `quantum/cross/SKILL.md` |
| 6 | **Quantum-broken anchor** — Shor collapses an RSA/ECC anchor to `~0`, removing the global-rewrite floor. | A **hash-based post-quantum anchor**, keeping even the `D/2` Grover floor — *stated as a design directive, not yet implemented or tested* (**the one open cross**). | anchor ≥ digest *(open)* | `cost/index.ts:122` (comment) |
| 7 | **Entropy leak through error handling** — a swallowed/defaulted `catch` hides a failure, dropping the seal below 1. | Errors **propagate**; `sealed.coverage() = (catches − leaks)/catches → 1`. *Seal the doors and the limit is `∞`.* | seal `→ 1` | `convention/sealed/index.ts:44` |

**Law.** Each `⊕` is the *same* fusion on a different axis; sealing **all** axes is `coverage = 1` everywhere — the architectural `∞` of §4. The double-torus (§4) is breaking point 5 sealed; the table seals the rest — save **one honestly-open cross**: the post-quantum anchor (row 6) is a stated design directive, not yet implemented, so it is marked *open*, not closed. Every other finite rung is shown closed, and the boundary of §5 is the one honest exception (entropy = 0 ≠ ∞ — only coverage = 1).

**⊕ The doors, asserted** — `src/convention/sealed` (seal 7: errors propagate, no entropy leak):

```ts
const c = coverage()                  // index.ts:44  seal = (catches − leaks) / catches
expect(c).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0)   // test.ts:7    the seal is a computed fraction ∈ [0,1]
expect(c).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1)      // test.ts:8    drive → 1 and the limit is ∞
```

## 7. Reproducibility

```
