description: Use when an entity needs quick free-text find across a few key columns — code/name/barcode/number lookup. The SearchConcern/quick_search (ransack) pattern → a Payload where/like query or a search index.

# search — typed find vs. free-text find

`search` is the lookup atom (Rails `SearchConcern`: `ransacker :search`, `quick_search` across `code/name/barcode/number`). Two duals: **identification** (the query matches a documented identifier → a definite resolve by id/uuid/code/number — see [[identity]]) and **free-text search** (no identifier match → a `where`/`like` over the searchable columns, [[queries]]). Declare the searchable fields (`listSearchableFields`, [[admin]]); for large corpora push to a real index (Vectorize/Analytics, [[bindings]]) rather than `like`-scanning. On D1 normalize at write — don't rely on SQL `LOWER` (no ICU).

Composes: [[queries]] (`like`/`where`), [[identity]] (identifier resolve), [[admin]] (searchable fields), [[bindings]] (index).

## Common mistakes
- `like`-scanning a huge table instead of an index.
- Relying on `LOWER()` matching on D1 — normalize at write.
