# depreciate — depreciation schedules (pure compute)

`calculate/depreciate` ports the etrima/erpax depreciation calculators verbatim ([[calculate]], [[port]]): given cost, salvage, useful-life (and units for activity-based), compute the per-period charge by method — **straight-line**, **declining-balance (DDB)**, **sum-of-years-digits**, **units-of-activity**. Pure function, no persistence; the result feeds [[accounting]] (the depreciation journal), but the calc holds no state. Cite the standard (IAS-16 / US-GAAP ASC-360). Money is amount + [[currency]].

## Common mistakes
- Storing the schedule as state in the calculator — it's pure; persist the resulting journal in [[accounting]].
- Conflating the method formulas — one leaf per method-family, or branch explicitly.
