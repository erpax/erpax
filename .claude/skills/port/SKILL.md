description: Use when porting a Rails/ActiveAdmin ERP feature (from etrima or ceccec/erpax) into Payload/Next — mapping ActiveAdmin resource registrations to CollectionConfig, Rails concerns to reusable field-factories/skills, controllers/callbacks to endpoints/hooks, CanCan authorization to access control, polymorphic/self-referential associations to relationships. The Rails↔Next / ActiveAdmin↔Payload Rosetta Stone.

# port — Rails/ActiveAdmin → Payload/Next (same shape, different host)

ActiveAdmin is to Rails what Payload is to Next: a declarative layer where ONE resource/collection definition auto-generates the admin UI, forms, access control, and lifecycle callbacks. Once the correspondence is seen, porting the Rails erpax (`~/github/ceccec/erpax`) + etrima (`~/github/ceccec/etrima`) into Payload erpax is mechanical — each Rails construct has a Payload home. Ordered by the [[sequence]]; the composable atoms (concerns) become reusable field-objects + skills.

## The Rosetta Stone
| Rails / ActiveAdmin | Payload / Next | skill |
|---|---|---|
| `ActiveAdmin.register Model do …end` | `CollectionConfig` | [[collections]] |
| ActiveRecord model + columns | collection `fields[]` (→ payload-types schema) | [[fields]] |
| **concern** (mixin: Host/Accountable/Currency/Number…) | **reusable field-factory / field-object** (composable atom) | [[fields]] · [[accounting]] |
| `index do; column …end` | `admin.defaultColumns` + cell components | [[admin]] |
| `form do; f.input …end` (formtastic) | field types (text/select/relationship/array/blocks…) | [[fields]] |
| `filter :x` / `scope :balanced` | list `where` filters / query presets | [[queries]] |
| `member_action` / `collection_action` | custom `endpoints[]` | [[api]] |
| `controller do; before_action…end`, `before_save`/`after_create` | collection `hooks` (beforeChange/afterChange…) | [[hooks]] |
| CanCan/Pundit `authorize_resource` / `can?` | `access` (read/create/update/delete → bool or Where) | [[access]] |
| `belongs_to` / `has_many` | `relationship` (`relationTo: 'slug'`, `hasMany`) | [[fields]] |
| polymorphic `belongs_to …, polymorphic: true` | `relationship` `relationTo: [..slugs..]` | [[accounting]] |
| self-referential `has_many :children` (Account/Invoice trees) | relationship-to-self (`relationTo: <own slug>`) | [[accounting]] |
| `permit_params` | field-level `access` + validation | [[access]] |
| ActiveJob / ActionMailer | Payload jobs queue / email | [[jobs]] · [[config]] |
| hand-written migrations | Payload-**generated** migrations (never hand-edited) | [[database]] |
| `application_controller` (tenant + 402 payment gate) | access + subscription gates + multi-tenant plugin | [[access]] |
| Rails initializers / `config/` | `payload.config.ts` / `next.config` | [[config]] |
| ERB views / partials | React Server Components / blocks | [[admin]] |
| content-addressed identity (SHA) ↔ federation | content-uuid (`.uuid`) | [[identity]] |

## The key isomorphism (why "all comes to place")
A Rails **concern** = a Payload **reusable field-object** = an erpax **skill**: one composable unit mixed into many models/collections. Double-entry balance, polymorphic accountability ("anything is accountable"), self-referential document trees, and tenant + payment gating all transfer 1:1 (see [[accounting]]). The single anti-pattern to NOT port literally is etrima's `option_1..12` grid — replace with composable `dimensions` + generated variants ([[manufacturing]]), the same composition principle.

## Source apps (read the original)
- `~/github/ceccec/erpax` — canonical Rails erpax: concerns, `accounting_equation.rb`, `invoice.rb` (self-referential tree), `application_controller.rb` (tenant + 402 gate).
- `~/github/ceccec/etrima` — garment manufacturing: `work_order.rb` (option_1..12 → port via [[manufacturing]]), `app/admin/production/*`, `app/admin/reports/*`.

## Common mistakes
- Porting ActiveAdmin per-resource tweaks into bespoke admin React instead of Payload's declarative `admin` config.
- Re-implementing a concern in each collection instead of ONE shared field-factory (the concern's whole point — DRY).
- Hand-writing migrations (Payload generates them from the schema).
- Carrying `option_1..12` across literally instead of composable dimensions ([[manufacturing]]).
- Hard-coding a `relationTo: 'specific-slug'` where the Rails side was polymorphic — keep it `relationTo: [..]` (see [[plugins]]).
