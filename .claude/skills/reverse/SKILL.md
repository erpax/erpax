# reverse — swap the source's debit↔credit, same accounts

A reversal is not a new computation; it is the **mirror of an existing balanced entry**: take the source [[accounting]] journal entry's `lines`, swap each line's `debit` and `credit`, keep the SAME `glAccount`. Because the source satisfied Σdebit = Σcredit ([[balance]]), the swap satisfies it too — **balanced by construction, never re-keyed**. Debit↔credit is the [[give]]↔[[take]] two-step ([[duality]]); reversal walks it backward.

## The law
- **Derive, don't re-enter.** Read the source entry (`findByID` its `journalEntryId`); map `lines → { glAccount, debit: line.credit, credit: line.debit, … }`. Never reconstruct amounts from a flat net — a single account + net is not a balanced entry ([[part]] vs [[whole]]).
- **Post forward in time, not in place.** A period-close reversal posts at the NEXT period's start (`entryDate = nextPeriodStartDate`) — the `9→1` octave step ([[close]] → [[begin]]; see [[sequence]]). Same-period reversal would re-open a sealed period ([[close]] forbids it).
- **Trace the origin.** `sourceType: 'period_end_adjustment'`, `sourceId = <source entry id>`, `sourceEvent: 'closing:reversed'` — the reversal carries its source's content-uuid lineage ([[identity]]) so the audit chain links mirror↔original.
- **Status `draft`.** Generated reversals enter draft; posting follows the normal gate (SoD, period-lock).

## Standards
@accounting IFRS IAS-1 presentation; IAS-34 §B interim-period reversals · @standard OECD SAF-T §3 reversal-entries (distinct GL + posting date) · @compliance SOX §404 reversal-traceability · @audit ISO-19011 mirror↔origin link.

## Common mistakes
- Building a reversal from a flat `{ account, debitAmount, creditAmount }` net — it can't satisfy the lines-based, ≥2-line double-entry schema; read the source's lines.
- Posting the reversal in the same (now-sealed) period instead of next-period-start.
- Re-keying amounts (drift) instead of swapping the source lines (exact mirror).
