# authenticated — logged-in read predicate

The baseline [[access]] gate: `Boolean(req.user)`. It grants any caller whose request carries a resolved user (identity established by [[auth]]) and denies anonymous callers. This is Payload's default-style "must be signed in" predicate.

Matter-twin: `src/authenticated/index.ts` (`authenticated = ({ req: { user } }) => Boolean(user)`). Composes [[access]] · [[auth]].

**Law — [[law]]: presence of a verified `req.user` is the gate — `authenticated` grants iff a session exists ([[auth]]), denying every anonymous caller.**
