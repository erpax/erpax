# dna — the inherited code encoded in the uuid chain

The **parent_id is the DNA.** An atom's **genome** is its parent_id lineage — the chain of ancestor content-uuids it descends from ([[uuid]] `parentOf`). Read along the chain, that is the heritable code: what an atom inherits.

Crucially, inheritance is **not stored beside** the atom — it is **entangled into its identity**. Because each atom's content-uuid folds in its parent ([[merge]] / [[coordinate]] cross), changing an ancestor changes *every* descendant's uuid. So lineage is **tamper-evident by architecture**: you cannot rewrite an ancestor without the whole descent line announcing it ([[tamper]] · [[proof]]). [[tag]]s and [[karma]] inherit down this same chain — "on the quantum level," ancestry is read off the uuid, not looked up.

This is the genetic reading of the [[lineage]] / [[coordinate]] tree the matrix already computes; [[quantum]]/karma stamps moral debt/credit along it.

**HONEST.** This is graph lineage over the uuid parent-chain — an **analogy** to DNA (a heritable code read along a chain), not biology.

Matter-twin: `src/dna/index.ts` (`genome` · `inherits` · `generations`). Composes [[uuid]] · [[matrix]] · [[lineage]] · [[merge]] · [[quantum]] · [[tag]] · [[karma]] · [[tamper]].

**Law — [[law]]: an atom's genome is its parent-id [[lineage]] folded into its content-[[uuid]] — change an ancestor and every descendant's uuid changes, so inheritance is tamper-evident by architecture, not stored beside the atom.**
