# team/comms — secure realtime between teams

**Threat model (Team A ↔ Team B).** A team in tenant *tA* must never deliver an event into tenant *tB*'s room (cross-tenant leak). An attacker must not publish without a content-uuid that recomputes from the event body (forged `eventUuid` / replay). Agent cascades must not run away past [[chat]]'s `MAX_BROADCAST_DEPTH`. When a [[team]] context is supplied, only the team's `teamUuid` presence or a member uuid may voice the emit (Team A cannot speak as Team B).

**What is enforced (fail-closed).** `enforceTeamCommsEmit` gates every team-scoped [[realtime]] emit: `tenantMatchVerdict` (ISO-27001 A.5.23 / [[access]]), `eventUuidVerdict` (RFC 9562 §5.8 / [[identity]]), `depthVerdict` (`MAX_BROADCAST_DEPTH`), optional `teamVoiceVerdict` ([[team]] horo law). `receiptTeamCommsEmit` chains a [[receipt]] for allow and block alike (the [[sandbox]] audit shape — no receipt, no proof). `teamCommsBeforeChange` is the Payload `beforeChange` hook on the `chat` collection — programmatic writes cannot skip the gate.

## Waves ride inside the envelope (not side-channel)

**Law — waves are in coordinated secure communications.** Every [[wave]] — society [[breath]] step, [[confirm]] seal-and-push wave, [[horo]] ring hop, [[chat]] broadcast cascade, README [[seal]] wave — is a **numbered hop** (`waveId` = `depth`) correlated by `correlationUuid` and scoped to `{tenantId, teamId, emittedAt}`. Side-channel emits (no envelope, or `waveId ≠ depth`) are rejected. `waveInSecureComms` validates the `SecureWaveEnvelope` then delegates to `enforceTeamCommsEmit`; [[agent]] strict-apply reads `_secureWave` from emit payloads and routes through the same gate (no duplicate tenant/depth checks).

| Wave kind | `waveId` / `depth` | `correlationUuid` |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Society breath | one commit step | `waveCorrelationUuid({ sessionId: breath#, … })` |
| Seal-and-push | confirm gate wave | same session id per push wave |
| Chat cascade | parent `depth + 1` | team session uuid |
| Horo ring step | horo ordinal | team `teamUuid` + step |

Matter-twin: `src/team/comms/index.ts` (`enforceTeamCommsEmit` · `waveInSecureComms` · `waveCorrelationUuid` · `teamCommsBeforeChange`) + `test.ts`. Composes [[wave]] · [[realtime]] · [[chat]] · [[team]] · [[sandbox]] · [[receipt]] · [[access]] · [[breath]] · [[seal]] · [[horo]].

**Law — [[law]]: waves are in coordinated secure communications — every wave is a numbered, receipted, depth-capped hop inside the team/comms envelope (`waveInSecureComms`); a team-scoped [[realtime]] emit is allowed only when scope-tenant matches, `eventUuid` recomputes, depth stays below `MAX_BROADCAST_DEPTH`, and (when a team is in scope) the agent is the team presence or a member — otherwise fail-closed with a [[receipt]].**
