# multi/search — when the query is not an identifier, it is a search across everything

Identification answers a typed identifier. Anything else routes here: `multiSearch` runs a
tenant-scoped query across the collections in scope, ORing over the text fields
`searchableFieldsOf` reports for each, and returns a flat array of `MultiSearchHit` rows.

Each hit carries its source collection and its content-uuid, so the caller can group, paginate or
re-rank without going back to ask what a result was. Nothing external is required — the internal
strategy iterates the live config, so it works offline.

Composes: [[uuid]] · [[law]].
