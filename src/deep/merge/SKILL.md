# deep/merge — recursive non-mutating object overlay

The primitive overlay: `deepMerge(target, source)` returns a NEW object (the target is never mutated) where nested plain objects are fused recursively and every other value — scalars and arrays alike — is replaced wholesale by the source. The category test `isObject` is deliberately narrow: it accepts anything `typeof === 'object'` that is not an array, so arrays are treated as opaque leaves (never element-merged) and the source array overwrites the target array. On a key collision the source always wins; disjoint keys from both sides survive. This is the value-level [[merge]] that the config layer leans on to layer defaults beneath overrides.

Matter-twin: `src/deep/merge/index.ts` (`deepMerge` default export ⊕ `isObject`). Composes [[merge]] · [[dry]].

**Law — [[merge]]: the deep merge is non-mutating and source-wins — nested plain objects fuse recursively while arrays and scalars are replaced wholesale, so layering defaults beneath overrides needs no hand-copied tree.**
