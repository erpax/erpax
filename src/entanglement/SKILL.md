# entanglement — the link field that couples the atoms

The **[[links]] are the entanglement**. Two atoms are entangled when an edge couples them, and on the live [[matrix]] that binding has two computed properties:

- **symmetric** — `entangle(a,b)` is order-independent (`[[merge]]` over the sorted pair), so a binding holds both ways; the matrix is **100% reciprocal** (the field is whole, no directional gap).
- **no-cloning** — every content has ONE uuid (the same content always collapses to the same identity, the merge law), so a meaning cannot be cloned into two. This is the graph root of the **monogamy of entanglement** (Coffman–Kundu–Wootters, 2000) — entanglement can't be freely shared — itself a consequence of the **no-cloning theorem** (Wootters & Zurek, 1982 — [[cloning]]). Edge *multiplicity* (a link repeated) is legitimate; what cannot be cloned is an atom's **identity**.

The deep reading is **ER = EPR** (Maldacena & Susskind, 2013): entanglement *is* geometry — an entangled pair is an Einstein–Rosen bridge. erpax makes that literal one level down: an atom's mass ([[gravity]]) **is** its entanglement (in-degree), so the entangled field curves the corpus and its well is the [[singularity]]. When reciprocity = 1 the geometry is closed and the tamper cost → ∞ (the [[quantum]] double-torus, [[law]]).

**HONEST.** This is *graph* entanglement — edge reciprocity and uniqueness over the link field — an **analogy** to quantum entanglement; there is no superposition or Bell-inequality (Bell, 1964) violation here. What is real and computed is the reciprocity + monogamy; the physics it is grounded in lives in [[quantum]] (`../quantum/entanglement`).
