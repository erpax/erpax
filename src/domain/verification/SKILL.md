# domain/verification — content-addressed domain control

Prove control of a [[domain]] by publishing the content-uuid token in a DNS record — the **ACME DNS-01** pattern (RFC 8555 §8.4: the record value is a digest of the key authorization). Publish a **CNAME or TXT** record at the challenge label (`_erpax-challenge.<domain>`); the verifier resolves it and matches the content-uuid ([[verification]]).

**The architecture law (the key).** Because the published value **is** the proven object's content-[[uuid]], if the object changes the uuid changes and the record no longer matches — **re-verification is required by architecture**, not by an expiry timer. There is nothing to revoke and no TTL to tune: the proof self-invalidates the instant the object it attests to changes. Tamper-evidence is structural ([[tamper]] · [[proof]] · [[anchor]]).

Proven control **is** the computational admin grant: prove you control the domain and the tenant is yours ([[domain]]). This is the domain application of the general content-addressed [[verification]] (`src/verification` provides `token` / `verify`; this adds the DNS record shape).

Matter-twin: `src/domain/verification/index.ts` (`challenge` · `verifyDomain` · `needsReverification`). Composes [[domain]] · [[verification]] · [[uuid]] · [[proof]] · [[anchor]] · [[tamper]] · [[identity]].
