description: "Use when deciding a crop is ready to harvest — days-to-maturity (DTM, the scheduling constant from sow/transplant to first pick), the maturity index (color, firmness, size, °Brix sugar) that signals harvest readiness, and the harvest window before over-maturity. Harvest maturity (pick-point) differs from eating ripeness; DTM lengthens as daylight wanes."

# maturity — when the crop is ready (the harvest-readiness signal)

**maturity** is the crop's readiness to [[harvest]], with two faces. As **timing**: **days-to-maturity (DTM)** is the scheduling constant — average days from sow/[[transplant]] to first pick — from which sow, transplant, and target-harvest dates are back-calculated ([[planting]]); it *lengthens as daylight wanes*, so a fall crop's DTM exceeds its spring DTM. As **state**: the **maturity index** is the measurable signal to pick — color, firmness, size, and **°Brix** (refractometer sugar / soluble-solids, also a [[grade]] threshold) — over a **harvest window** before quality declines into over-maturity.

Harvest maturity (the pick-point — e.g. a breaker / mature-green tomato) often differs from eating ripeness. Maturity is the [[measure]] that triggers the [[harvest]] event and feeds the [[grade]] decision; it paces against the heat the crop accumulates ([[degreeday]]) through its [[season]].

## Standards
- UC Davis Postharvest Technology Center — maturity indices; *Knott's Handbook* — commercial/horticultural maturity
- Johnny's Selected Seeds — days-to-maturity charts; OSU Ohioline — °Brix as a quality indicator
