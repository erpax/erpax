# baseline — the measured reference a calibration is computed from

A **baseline** is the real-data INPUT a model fits to — for example an efficiency distribution `{ median 75, p99 167, standard 100 }` measured across observed shifts. It is the **data, not the calibration**: the calibration is [[derive]]d from the baseline, never hardcoded.

```ts
// the baseline is the observed distribution; the calibration is COMPUTED from it
export const BASELINE_EFFICIENCY = { medianPct: 75, p99Pct: 167, standardPct: 100 }
export const EFFICIENCY_CALIBRATION = computeCalibration(BASELINE_EFFICIENCY)
```

**Why split baseline from calibration.** Separating the measured input from the fitted output makes the model **self-recomputing**: change the [[source]] — another tenant, another year — and the curve refits itself with no edit to code. A hardcoded `{ 0.75, 1.0, 1.67 }` is a frozen guess; a baseline + `computeCalibration` is a living fit. This is the [[derive]] / [[empirical]] law in one artifact.

**Agnostic naming.** A baseline is named for its **role** — `BASELINE_EFFICIENCY`, `BASELINE_PAY` — never for the organisation it was measured at. The provenance (which company, which host, which rows, which years) is [[empirical]] warrant that lives in [[akashic]] / [[lineage]], not in the identifier. The number is universal; only the proper noun is anonymised away. This is anonymisation as agnostic architecture: the same baseline shape accepts any [[source]].

**On the ring.** A real distribution tends to cluster on a small set of harmonic positions ([[horo]] · [[rodin]]) — the median sits *below* the standard (off-gassing, see [[decompression]]), and the calibration reads those positions as the pay/allocation curve ([[allocation]]). The baseline is therefore also the bridge from raw measurement to the harmonic model.

Composes [[empirical]] · [[source]] · [[derive]] · [[calculate]] · [[measure]] · [[sampling]] · [[akashic]] · [[lineage]] · [[horo]] · [[rodin]] · [[decompression]] · [[allocation]] · [[manufacturing]].
