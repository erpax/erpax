# reconcile — match two sides of one flow

`reconcile` is the matching atom (Rails `BankStatementLineReconciliationConcern`: `reconcile_with!`/`unreconcile!`/`reconciled?`). Law: a reconciliation is a **link** between two records of the same value-flow (bank-statement line ↔ payment; GL ↔ subledger; intercompany debit ↔ credit). `reconciled?` is **DERIVED** from whether the link exists (and amounts agree) — never a stored boolean (the [[manufacturing]]/[[commerce]] derived-status lesson). Matching runs in a [[hooks]] / [[jobs]] task (fuzzy by amount+date+ref); unmatched both-sides are `where`-filter scopes ([[queries]]). Sits under [[accounting]] (sequence **6**).

Composes: [[accounting]] (the ledger sides), [[hooks]]/[[jobs]] (match run), [[queries]] (unreconciled scopes), [[currency]] (amounts agree per currency).

## Common mistakes
- Storing a `reconciled` boolean instead of deriving it from the match link.
- Matching across different currencies without converting ([[currency]] exchangeRate).
