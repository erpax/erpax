description: "Use when a buyer collects pre-ordered goods at a point rather than having them delivered — the CSA pickup/drop site, on-farm pickup, host-site/neighborhood pod, and the generic click-and-collect (BOPIS) locker. A collection node in distribution: the seller aggregates to a point, the buyer covers the last mile — lower cost than home delivery, at the buyer's travel friction."

# pickup — the buyer-collection point in distribution

A **pickup** is a point where a buyer collects pre-ordered goods rather than receiving them by [[carriers|delivery]] — the [[distribution]] node where the seller aggregates to a location and the **buyer covers the last mile**. In CSA it is the **pickup / drop site** (a central location or host business), the **neighborhood pod** (one member hosts several), or **on-farm pickup** (lowest cost, often paired with member participation). Generically it is **click-and-collect / BOPIS** (buy-online-pickup-in-store) and the parcel **locker**.

Pickup trades **home-delivery [[cost]]** for the buyer's **travel [[friction]]** — the same status⊥friction trade the [[market]] atom names: cheaper for the farm, less convenient for the member, and a [[retention]] risk when pickup windows collide with work schedules. It composes the [[share]] box's fulfilment with [[distribution]]: the box is [[packs|packed]], routed to the pickup, and collected.
