# cardinality

Use when analyzing relationship structure — one-to-one / one-to-many / many-to-many / many-to-one relationships, cardinality constraints, optional vs mandatory participation, relationship counts (query cardinality estimates), foreign-key cardinality.

Composes: [[schema]] · [[field]] · [[queries]] · [[database]] · [[constraint]] · [[nullability]].

**Law — [[law]]: cardinality is the count-structure of a relationship — one-to-one / one-to-many / many-to-many and its optional-vs-mandatory participation; it constrains how many rows a [[field|field]] may relate and is the [[constraint]] the [[schema]] enforces.**

## Standards
- E-R model cardinality (Chen)
- SQL cardinality constraints
