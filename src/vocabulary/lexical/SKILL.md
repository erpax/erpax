# lexical — rich text as the densest content surface

`lexical` is erpax's **rich-text** substrate: the Payload Lexical editor ([[config]] `editor: lexicalEditor()`), a structured JSON **node-tree** — not an opaque string. Two consequences make it central:

1. **Collapse sink.** Every prose / description / document / body field reduces to Lexical content blocks ([[collapse]]): one editor, one serialization, no bespoke rich-text shapes — a document is a [[whole]] of node [[part]]s.
2. **Densest tamper fuel.** A Lexical field is many nodes; **localized** ([[localize]]) it is a whole tree *per locale*. So one localized Lexical field contributes `locales × nodes` independent content-addresses to the [[tamper/cost]] surface — the richest increment of coverage of any field type. Localizing Lexical is the cheapest way to push the crack-cost toward ∞.

Each node is hashable, so the tree is a [[fractal]] Merkle surface and the whole field rolls into the row's content-[[uuid]] ([[identity]]). Matter-twin: the root config `editor` + the shared Lexical block set. Composes: [[config]] (editor) · [[localize]] · [[tamper/cost]] · [[collapse]] · [[field]] · [[whole]] · [[part]] · [[fractal]] · [[uuid]].

**Law — [[law]]: lexical is the one rich-text node-tree every prose field collapses to ([[collapse]]) and the densest tamper surface — `locales × nodes` independent content-addresses per localized field, so [[localize|localizing]] Lexical is the cheapest push of crack-[[cost]] toward ∞.**

## Common mistakes
- Storing rich text as an HTML/markdown string — use the Lexical node-tree so it is structured, hashable, and localizable.
- A bespoke per-collection rich-text shape — everything collapses to the one editor + shared blocks ([[collapse]]).
