# privilege — the confidentiality wall (access scope + crypto-shred)

**Privilege** — attorney-client confidentiality and the ethical wall that screens a [[matter]] from conflicted staff — is an [[access]] scope: a capability on the role × isolation to the matter's tenant, computed by the role→capability cross, never a by-name grant. erpax cannot natively keep a secret (its design limit is detect-not-prevent), so privilege is enforced two ways — [[access]] gates *reads*, and crypto-shred makes a sealed document unrecoverable once its key is destroyed (confidentiality as key management, the [[localize]] tamper-cost fusion). A [[conflict]] found screens the affected staff outside the wall; the wall itself is tamper-evident ([[proof]]). Composes [[access]] · [[matter]] · [[conflict]] · [[localize]] · [[proof]] · [[data/processing/activities]] · [[internal/controls]] · [[beyond]].

**Law — [[law]]: privilege is a computed [[access]] scope (capability × matter isolation) plus crypto-shred, never a by-name grant — since erpax keeps no native secret, confidentiality is enforced by gating reads and by destroying a key, not by trusting a label.**
