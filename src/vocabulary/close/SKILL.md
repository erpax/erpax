# close — the forbidding state (locked · sealed)

`close` is the universal root of the **forbidding boundary**: a fiscal period *closes* / locks → no GL writes for any date in it ([[accounting]]); a document seals → its content-uuid is frozen, immutable ([[identity]], [[versions]]); a shift / stream finishes. Dual of [[open]]. The month-end *close* assembles and freezes the period ([[accounting]]). Enforced by a write-guard [[hooks]] — the [[end]] of a [[flow]].

## Traditions (prefix removed)
The sealing boundary every tradition keeps: the **Day of Judgment** — the books locked and weighed, no deed added after ([[accounting]], [[akashic]]); the **Sabbath** / *Shabbat* — work forbidden, the day set apart and sealed (Exodus 20:8-11); the seal of the prophets (*khatam an-nabiyyin*, Quran 33:40); the seal of the fast. To close is to forbid further writing — the locked period, the sealed scroll ([[identity]] freeze-on-seal). Dual of [[open]].

**Law — [[law]]: close is the universal forbidding boundary — a fiscal period locks (no GL writes), a document seals (content-[[uuid]] frozen), a stream finishes; the [[end]] of a [[flow]], dual of [[open]], enforced by a write-guard.**
