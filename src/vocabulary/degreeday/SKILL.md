description: "Use when crop development is predicted from accumulated heat rather than the calendar — growing degree days (GDD = (Tmax+Tmin)/2 − Tbase, capped) measure the heat a crop banks toward maturity, so a warm spring advances harvest and a cool one delays it. The heat-unit clock that makes a fixed-week calendar drift; pairs with frost and evapotranspiration."

# degreeday — the heat-unit clock that paces crop development

A **growing degree day (GDD)** is a unit of accumulated heat above a crop's base temperature: `GDD = (Tmax + Tmin)/2 − Tbase`, floored at zero and often capped (e.g. the 86/50 °F method for warm-season crops). Crops develop by **banked heat, not calendar days** — a hybrid needs a fixed GDD total to reach [[maturity]] regardless of date — so a warm spring advances the [[harvest]] week and a cool one delays it. This is precisely why a fixed-week availability calendar **drifts** year to year and is only ever a [[forecast|projection]].

degreeday is the heat clock of the [[season]]: the time-base that predicts [[maturity]] and [[harvest]] more reliably than calendar-DTM, the twin of the water-demand [[evapotranspiration]] (both are weather integrals) and the partner of the [[frost]] bound. It is a [[measure]] (°-days) the [[planting]] schedule is calibrated against.

## Standards
- Ohio State AGF-101 — growing degree days (the 86/50 method); OSU Croptime / UC IPM — degree-day crop models
- Michigan State / Purdue Extension — GDD & phenology

Composes [[agriculture]] · [[season]] · [[maturity]] · [[harvest]] · [[frost]] · [[evapotranspiration]] · [[planting]] · [[forecast]] · [[measure]].

**Law — [[law]]: crops develop by banked heat, not calendar days — a fixed GDD total to [[maturity]] makes any fixed-week calendar drift, so degreeday is the true time-base the [[planting]] schedule is calibrated against ([[forecast]], never a fixed date).**
