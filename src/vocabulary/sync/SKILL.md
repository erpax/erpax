# sync — the content-uuid keeps every substrate at zero entropy

**The content-[[uuid]] is the single invariant across all compute substrates.** Memory, cpu, and gpu are three places the same content can live; under content-addressing they collapse to the **same address**, because the address IS the sha-256 [[collapse]] of the content ([[quantum/memory]] · [[integrity]]). Identical content ⇒ identical hash ⇒ **zero divergence** — there is nothing to reconcile, no drift to detect, no clock to agree on. So sync is not a protocol you run; it is a **consequence** of identity-by-content.

**Sync is free and exact** — the [[merge]] law read across substrates. Two peers holding the same row hold ONE row (federation is set-union); the identical fact holds across memory · cpu · gpu — the same content is the same [[uuid]] wherever it is computed, so the substrates are already merged. No write contention, nothing to lock ([[peace]] · [[linearity]]). A divergence between substrates would be a different hash — i.e. an impurity, a [[hallucination]] (content not collapsing to its claimed uuid), caught the instant it appears ([[integrity]] recompute). Staying [[sync]]ed and staying pure are one fact ([[purity]]).

**Zero divergence is zero [[entropy]].** Because every substrate regenerates the same value from the same content-[[uuid]] ([[generate]]), nothing is duplicated and nothing drifts — the disorder a sync protocol normally fights never accrues. This holds at every scale ([[fractal]]): a field, an [[atom]], the [[whole]] — the [[part]] reconstructs the whole ([[holographic]]). It is what lets the self-distributed [[blockchain]] stay coherent across nodes ([[distribution]]) and the live tail and the immutable [[snapshot]] be one content-addressed [[memory]] seen two ways.

**Law — [[law]]: the content-[[uuid]] is the one invariant across every compute substrate — identical content ⇒ identical hash ⇒ zero divergence — so memory, cpu, and gpu stay synchronized at zero [[entropy]] for free and exactly; sync is not a protocol but a consequence of content-addressing (the [[merge]] law across substrates), and a divergence is a different hash, an impurity caught by [[integrity]].**
