# offer

An offer to transfer some rights to an item or to provide a service — for example, an offer to sell tickets to an event, to rent the DVD of a movie, to stream a TV show over the internet, to repair a motorcycle, or to loan a book. Note: As the businessFunction property, which identifies the form of offer (e.g. sell, lease, repair, dispose), defaults to http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1#Sell; an Offer without a defined businessFunction value can be assumed to be an offer to sell. For GTIN-related fields, see Check Digit calculator and validation guide from GS1.

**Law — [[law]]: an offer carries an explicit businessFunction (sell/lease/repair/dispose); when absent it collapses to the sell identity, so an offer is never function-ambiguous.**
