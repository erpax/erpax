# animal — the individual living beast; the member of a herd

An **animal** is one identified living beast — the member of a [[herd]] and the row a [[biological/assets|biological asset]] is measured on. It carries its **class** (cow/heifer/steer/bull/calf, ewe/ram/lamb, sow/boar/piglet, layer/broiler — an enum, not separate atoms), **sex**, **purpose** (dairy/meat/fiber/breeding), and **lifecycle [[maturity]] stage** (weaner → yearling → finished/lactating → cull). Its official ear-tag / RFID is its [[identity]] ([[id]]); its parentage is [[lineage]] (pedigree, sire/dam).

The animal is where the husbandry atoms attach: its [[health]] record (vaccination, the [[withdrawal]] embargo), its [[breed]], its [[lactation]] or finishing, and at [[harvest]] its produce (milk/wool/eggs) or carcass. Death is a [[mortality]] event that de-recognizes the asset. Held-for-sale vs breeding is a [[biological/assets]] classification (both stay IAS-41).

**Law — [[law]]: the individual identified beast is the node — one animal carrying its class/sex/purpose/lifecycle stage, keyed by its ear-tag/RFID [[identity]] — and it is the row a [[biological/assets]] asset is measured on and to which every husbandry atom attaches.**
