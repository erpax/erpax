# frost — the freeze event that bounds the season

**frost** is the freeze event that bounds the growing [[season]]: the **last spring frost** and **first fall frost** define the **frost-free period** — the window that caps which [[crop]]s are even feasible (a 180-day frost-free belt grows melons; a 90-day one forces quick crops). Frost dates are **probabilistic, not fixed** — derived per weather station at a confidence level (e.g. "50% chance of 32 °F after this date") — so the relevant date is the *local* one; a copied or town-average date misfires.

Frost is the hard bound the [[season]] is cut from, and the event two things buffer against: **[[tunnel]]s** (row cover, high tunnel — built protection) and crop **[[hardiness]]** (biological cold tolerance — hardy crops shrug off light frost, tender ones die at it). It anchors all the date math the [[degreeday]] heat-clock then paces.

## Standards
- NC State / land-grant extension — average first/last frost dates (probabilistic, per-station)
- USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map (2023); NOAA climate normals (freeze/frost probabilities)

Composes [[agriculture]] · [[season]] · [[crop]] · [[tunnel]] · [[hardiness]] · [[degreeday]] · [[planting]].

**Law — [[law]]: frost is the freeze event that bounds the [[season]] — last-spring and first-fall frost define the frost-free window that caps which [[crop]]s are feasible; the dates are probabilistic per-station, never a fixed calendar.**
