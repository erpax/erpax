description: "Use when modelling soil water as a managed reservoir — the plant-available water held between field capacity (after drainage) and the permanent wilting point, the slice irrigation refills and evapotranspiration drains. A capacity reservoir on the water axis, the twin of the soil's nutrient budget."

# moisture — soil water held as a plant-available reservoir

**moisture** is water held in [[soil]] pores — the managed supply pool of [[agriculture]]'s water axis. Its bounds: **field capacity** (water remaining after free drainage, ≈ −⅓ bar) and the **permanent wilting point** (≈ −15 bar, below which plants cannot recover turgor); the slice between them is **available water capacity (AWC)** — the plant-usable reservoir (a loam holds ≈ 3.8 in/ft).

Moisture is a [[capacity]] reservoir on the water axis — the twin of [[fertility]]'s nutrient budget: **[[irrigation]]** and rain credit it, **[[evapotranspiration]]** debits it, and the grower replaces the deficit before the crop hits stress ([[balance]]). It is raised by organic matter, [[mulch]], and reduced [[tillage]] (more pore space holds more water). Soil-water tension drives both plant uptake and sensor-based [[schedule|scheduling]].

## Standards
- Cornell NRCCA — soil water (field capacity, wilting point, AWC); USDA-NRCS — available water capacity
- METER Group — plant-available-water measurement (matric potential)

Composes [[agriculture]] · [[soil]] · [[irrigation]] · [[evapotranspiration]] · [[capacity]] · [[balance]] · [[fertility]] · [[mulch]] · [[schedule]].

**Law — [[law]]: soil moisture is a [[capacity]] reservoir bounded by field capacity and the wilting point — irrigation/rain credit it, evapotranspiration debits it, and the deficit is refilled before crop stress ([[balance]]); the water-axis twin of the nutrient budget.**
