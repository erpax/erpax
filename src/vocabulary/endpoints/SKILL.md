# endpoints — the custom-route organ (the `/next/seed` demo loader)

A Payload **endpoint** is a custom HTTP handler mounted outside the auto-generated collection REST/GraphQL surface ([[api]]) — for work that isn't one document's CRUD. Today this organ holds **one** such handler: `seed`, the website-template demo-data loader, exposed at `/next/seed` (the Next route `app/(frontend)/next/seed/route.ts` calls it; the folder is aliased `@/n`). It is **destructive and one-shot**: it clears the demo [[collections]] + globals, deletes the demo author, then re-creates example media, three linked posts, a contact form, the home + contact pages, the header/footer nav, and the 18 erpax product-marketing pages — all via the Local API ([[api]] `payload.create`/`updateGlobal`).

This is the **demo / marketing** seed — distinct from the structural [[seed]] atom (a tenant's opening chart-of-accounts + compliance posture, which is idempotent). This one wipes and rebuilds a showcase tenant; run it on a fresh instance, never over live data. Its fixtures (`home.ts`, `post-*.ts`, `image-*.ts`) are static, locale-bundled (BCP-47), and inherit the seed barrel's standards; remote demo images are fetched from the upstream Payload template. The erpax product pages pitch each wired [[commerce]] capability with its standards backing — the monetization surface a tenant boots with.

Matter-twin: `src/endpoints/seed/index.ts` (the `seed` handler + `fetchFileByURL`), `seed/erpax-product-pages.ts` (the 18 product pages), `seed/{home,contact-page,contact-form,post-1,post-2,post-3,image-*}.ts` (static fixtures).
Composes: [[api]] · [[collections]] · [[seed]] · [[identity]] · [[config]] · [[society]] · [[commerce]].

**Law — [[law]]: an endpoint is a custom HTTP handler mounted outside collection CRUD for work that is not one document's create/read/update/delete; today the one organ-scoped handler is the destructive, one-shot `/next/seed` demo loader — run on a fresh instance, never over live data.**
