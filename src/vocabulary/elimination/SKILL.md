Use when removing intercompany balances, transactions, and profits in consolidation per IFRS-10 and IFRS-3 — consolidation adjustment that nets balances across entities to zero

Composes: [[Consolidations]] · [[consolidation/eliminations]] · [[legal/entities/intercompany/transactions]] · [[journal/entries]] · [[balance]] · [[transaction]].

**Law — [[law]]: consolidation nets intercompany balances, transactions, and profits to zero — the group reports as one entity, so what one member owes another cancels ([[balance]]).**

## Standards
- IFRS-10 §19-28 (consolidated financial statements mechanics)
- IFRS-3 §52 (elimination in consolidation)
- FASB ASC 810-10-45 (intercompany elimination)
