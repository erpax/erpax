name: evapotranspiration
description: "Use when quantifying crop water demand — evapotranspiration (ET) = soil evaporation + plant transpiration, the daily withdrawal from the soil-moisture reservoir that drives irrigation scheduling. The debit side of the water budget; reference ET × crop coefficient gives the crop's actual draw."

# evapotranspiration — the crop's water demand (the budget's debit)

**evapotranspiration (ET)** is the combined water loss from **soil evaporation** + plant **transpiration** — the demand side of [[agriculture]]'s water [[balance]] and the daily **withdrawal** from the [[moisture]] reservoir that [[irrigation]] and rain must replace. Reference ET (ET₀, a weather-station potential) × a stage-specific **crop coefficient (Kc)** gives a crop's *actual* draw — the [[rate]] (depth per day) that sizes irrigation.

ET rises with heat, wind, and canopy; it is the water twin of the heat-driven [[degreeday]] that paces [[maturity]]. Track it and the checkbook stays solvent: deposits (rain + irrigation) − withdrawals (ET) = remaining [[moisture]] ([[balance]]).

## Standards
- FAO-56 — reference ET (ET₀) and crop coefficients (Kc); UMN / UC Extension — ET-based scheduling
- METER Group — ET and plant-available water

Composes [[agriculture]] · [[moisture]] · [[irrigation]] · [[balance]] · [[rate]] · [[degreeday]] · [[season]] · [[measure]].

**Law — [[law]]: evapotranspiration is the debit of the water budget, so remaining soil moisture equals deposits (rain + irrigation) minus this withdrawal; the reservoir cannot be drawn past zero without a deposit.**
