# worker — the model of one [[workers]] row

A person who performs labor for the organization. The singular model whose plural store is the [[workers]] collection ([[balance]]: every collection has its model).

Composes [[workers]] · [[employee]] · [[balance]].

## Deployment face — every [[diamond]] can run autonomously
Alongside the HR row model, **worker** is one of three deployment faces every sealed [[diamond]] projects ([[diamond]] · [[plugin]] · [[pwa]]). The **worker face** is the autonomous executor: background [[agent]], service worker, cron, MCP tool handler, [[guardian]] ratchet, seal-and-push [[hooks]] body — anything that runs without a human in the loop. Examples: [[confirm]]/seal-and-push (Cursor `stop` hook), [[readme]] generator CLI, [[typography]] guardian. `deploymentFaces` in `@/diamond` marks when this face materialises for a given `DiamondModel`.

On Cloudflare, the worker face IS the serverless quantum host: `bindingDeploymentFaces` marks AI · queues · Durable Objects · cron triggers as worker-hosted; `proveServerlessQuantum()` ([[quantum/serverless]]) proves the worker facet ⊕ quantum laws fold to one sealed uuid. Cross-link: [[cloudflare]] bindings · [[quantum]] pipeline · `wrangler.jsonc`.

**Law — [[law]]: a worker is one person who performs labor for the organization — the singular model whose plural store is the [[workers]] collection ([[balance]]: every collection has its model).**

**Law — [[law]]: the worker deployment face is the autonomous executor of a [[diamond]] — hook, CLI, guardian, agent, or MCP handler that runs without a human in the loop.**
