# ebitda — earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization (pure compute)

`calculate/ebitda` ports the EBITDA calculator verbatim ([[calculate]], [[port]]): EBITDA = operating profit + depreciation + amortization (equivalently net income + interest + tax + D&A). Pure function over [[accounting]] P&L figures, no persistence. It is a **non-GAAP** measure — label it as such (SEC Reg-G discipline) and don't present it as a GAAP line. Money is amount + [[currency]]; the add-backs are read from [[accounting]], never hardcoded.

## Common mistakes
- Presenting EBITDA as a GAAP figure — it's non-GAAP; disclose the reconciliation.
- Hardcoding the add-backs instead of reading them from [[accounting]].
