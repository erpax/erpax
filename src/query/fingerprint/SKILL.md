# query/fingerprint — every SQL string has an address, so a query is a thing you can talk about

`canonicalizeSql` normalises a statement and `computeQueryUuid` addresses it, so the same query
issued from two places is recognisably one query. `runWithFingerprint` records the execution
against that address.

Without it, "which query is slow" is answered by pasting text at each other. With it, the
question has a key.
