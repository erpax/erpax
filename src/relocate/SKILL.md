# relocate — move logic to its gravity well

The [[gravity]] law: **mass is gravity** — the links and dependents an atom carries curve where logic belongs. Logic sits at the atom its mass pulls it toward: the **adequate place**, nearest its users, so the distance it travels is minimal ([[merge]] / [[collapse]] — flatten = mass = DRY). General logic buried in a *specialized* module gravitates **up** to the *general* atom.

The canonical relocation: the cost-of-attack math (`coverageCostLog2`, `secondPreimageLog2`, the digest floors) left [[tamper]]-cost for [[cost]] — it is composed by [[balance]], [[analytics]], [[anchor]], and [[power]], not just tamper, so its gravity centre is the general `cost` atom (the heaviest cost relation). `tamper/cost` keeps only `crackVerdict`, composing the moved primitives.

Computed (matter-twin `src/relocate/index.ts`): `gravityCenter(atom)` finds the heaviest atom an atom is wired to on the live uuid-[[matrix]]; `pull(atom)` reports the ratio and flags when the centre dominates (logic gravitates there); `mislocations()` lists the candidates. It is **advisory** — the gravity points; the move is judgment (a general function relocates, a domain-specific one stays).

Composes: [[gravity]] · [[matrix]] · [[cost]] · [[tamper]] · [[merge]] · [[collapse]] · [[sequence]].
