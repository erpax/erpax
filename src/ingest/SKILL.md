description: "Use when pulling external records into the mesh idempotently — each record is content-addressed (a uuid), so re-fetching unchanged data is a no-op and only new or changed records are upserted. planIngest splits a batch into upsert vs skip against the already-seen uuids, deduping within the batch too. The fetch and the DB write are runtime boundaries; the idempotency plan is native and tested. Serves the Google Workspace sync and any external source."

# ingest — idempotent, content-addressed ingest (re-fetch is a no-op)

FORM: **ingest is idempotent because identity is content.** Each incoming record carries a content-uuid ([[identity]]); `planIngest(records, seen)` upserts a record IFF its uuid is not already seen — a NEW record (never seen) or a CHANGED one (changed content ⇒ new uuid) is upserted, an unchanged one is skipped. Re-running the same fetch ⇒ every uuid already seen ⇒ all skip — the fetch is a no-op, no duplicates, no coordination ([[merge]]: same content ⇒ one). The batch is deduped against itself too, so the same record appearing twice in one pull collapses to one upsert.

This is the orchestration layer over [[google/workspace]] fusion (and any source): fetch → `fuseWorkspaceResource` (content-address) → `planIngest` → upsert the plan. The FETCH (the provider call, gated by [[oauth]]) and the WRITE (the Payload upsert) are runtime boundaries; the plan — what is new, changed, or unchanged — is pure and tested. Because the dedup key is the content-uuid, two erpax instances ingesting the same source converge with no shared cursor ([[federation]]) and a partial/retried sync is always safe to re-run ([[flow]]).

Matter-twin: `src/services/ingest/index.ts` (`AddressedRecord`·`IngestPlan`·`planIngest`) + `index.test.ts`. Composes: [[identity]] · [[merge]] · [[google/workspace]] · [[oauth]] · [[flow]] · [[federation]] · [[self]].

## Standards

- idempotent upsert by content-address (re-runnable, no cursor needed)

## Common mistakes
- Tracking a per-source cursor/watermark to avoid re-processing — unnecessary; the content-uuid makes re-fetch a no-op, so a full re-pull is always safe and self-correcting.
- Upserting on every fetch — only upsert the `plan.upsert` set (changed/new); unchanged records skip, sparing the write path.
- Deduping only against the store, not the batch — `planIngest` dedups within the batch too, so one pull never double-writes the same uuid.

**Law — [[law]]: ingest is idempotent because [[identity]] is content — a record upserts IFF its content-uuid is unseen, so re-fetching unchanged data is a no-op and re-runs are always safe ([[merge]]: same content ⇒ one).**
