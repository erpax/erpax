# shift

Use when modeling a span of worked time — the per-actor-day labour unit a work order's produced minutes roll up into, and the authority it reads efficiency and wage back down from. The singular of the work-shifts aggregate.

**A shift is one `(actor, day)` of presence, the model the [[shifts]] collection stores.** It is the [[accounting]] authority for labour: a [[work/orders|work order]] does not compute its own efficiency — it contributes produced minutes UP into the shift and reads `efficiencyPercent` back DOWN, the same direction a ledger account is the authority its postings sum into. The shift carries presence vs produced minutes and the `⌊produced·100/presence⌋` [[efficiency]], keyed by the [[employee]] (the actor) and run by a [[work/centers|work-centre]]. Grounded in 20 years of etrima production (`work_shifts`, 376k rows).

Composes: [[shifts]] · [[work/shifts]] · [[employee]] · [[accounting]] · [[efficiency]] · [[time]] · [[attendance]] · [[pay]] · [[horo]].

**Law — [[law]]: a shift is one `(actor, day)` of presence and the [[accounting]] authority for labour — produced minutes roll UP into it, [[efficiency]] (`⌊produced·100/presence⌋`) and wage read back DOWN, the same direction a ledger account is the authority its postings sum into.**
