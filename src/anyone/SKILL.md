# anyone — public read predicate (always grant)

The simplest [[access]] predicate: `() => true`. It grants every caller, authenticated or not, so a collection or field can expose itself to anonymous read. ISO 27002 §5.15 is still cited even though it GRANTS — the deliberate public-read is itself an access-control decision on the record.

Matter-twin: `src/anyone/index.ts` (`anyone: Access = () => true`). Composes [[access]].

**Law — [[law]]: a deliberate public grant is still an [[access]] decision — `anyone` returns `true` for every caller, anonymous or authenticated alike.**
