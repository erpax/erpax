# separation — the separation of powers, the SoD invariant at the scale of the state

FORM: **tyranny and fraud are the same violation at different scales — one check catches both.** The constitutional rule that no actor may hold two branches of the state IS the segregation-of-duties invariant that forbids the creator of a payment from approving it. So `separation` adds NO new logic; it APPLIES [[anti/corruption]]'s `detectSodViolation` to the three branches. Tyranny is structurally foreclosed exactly as self-dealing is — a would-be despot and a self-approving clerk fail the identical check (fractal: one law, every scale). Pure → testable (`index.test.ts`).

`checkSeparationOfPowers(holders)` → which branch pairs are unlawfully concentrated in one actor. The three pairs that must differ: legislative·executive, executive·judicial, legislative·judicial — no concentration of power.

This is the [[constitution]]'s foundation made political, the limit [[legislation]] inherits (the legislature cannot also adjudicate or execute its own statutes) and [[governance]] presupposes (the polity that decides is not the office that enforces). It is the control triad of the [[society]], position **3·6·9** on the ring — the governing axis that holds the rest in [[balance]]. The two sides are [[duality]]: power divided is power that checks itself.

**Law — [[law]]: tyranny and fraud are one violation at different scales — no actor may hold two branches of the state, the identical segregation-of-duties check that forbids a payment's creator from approving it (fractal: one law, every scale); adds no new logic.**

## Standards

- **Montesquieu** — separation-of-powers (legislative · executive · judicial).
- **SOX §404** — segregation-of-duties; the same invariant at the public-office scale.
