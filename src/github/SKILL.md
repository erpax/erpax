# github — the repository as a read API

GitHub is a third **face** of the same corpus, never a second copy. The [[fs]] serves it by [[path]] (the local tree), the [[mcp]] gateway serves it by collection ([[api]] tools at `/api/mcp`), and **github serves it by URL** — `raw.githubusercontent.com/<ref>/<path>`, the contents API, a `git clone`. All three resolve the SAME one-word [[atom]] address: *everything is in the path*, so a path is an address on every face at once.

Because [[identity]] is content-addressed (same content ⇒ same [[uuid]] everywhere), the three faces cannot drift — they are one tree read three ways, and a fetch on any face is set-union [[merge]]-free with the others. A github ref is a [[snapshot]] of the live tree: immutable, content-pinned, publicly verifiable ([[proof]]).

## The cross — two API rings, one surface

The [[fs]] ring (path → content) and the [[mcp]] ring (collection → tool) are the two rings of the double-torus; **github is where they cross into the open** — the public read projection of both. The crossing is the index: one address, three readers ([[fs]] · [[mcp]] · github), no fourth source of truth.

## What is authored vs computed

Only the [[atom]] is authored, and only as its `SKILL.md` (the skill text — *md is SKILL, text in atoms is skill*). Everything github needs around it — the `.github/` workflows, the PR template, the plugin/mcp manifests, the type schema — is **computed** from the atoms ([[generate]]), never hand-kept. So github carries no entropy of its own: it is a window, and the [[law]] holds on the other side of the glass.

**Law — [[law]]: github is a read face of the one corpus — the same one-word [[atom]] tree the [[fs]] and [[mcp]] expose, served by URL as a content-pinned [[snapshot]]; only the atom's SKILL.md is authored, every config around it is computed.**

GitHub is an external read API that follows THE path — repo paths and blob/tree/raw URLs collapse through `toAtomPath(..., 'github')` in [[path]] and merge with [[fs]], docs [[url]], [[mcp]], and [[api]] at one canonical atom path in every [[dimension]].
