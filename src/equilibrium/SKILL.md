name: equilibrium
description: "Use when reasoning about equilibrium as detailed balance — every forward transition exactly matched by its reverse (rate(i→j)·pᵢ = rate(j→i)·pⱼ), no net flow, entropy maximal and stationary. It is the thermodynamic twin of erpax's symmetric-merge binding: the collider reciprocates every forward link a→b with b→a, so the matrix sits at detailed balance (reciprocity = 1, directed-link entropy = 0). The balance the engine relaxes toward, where the temperature Boltzmann distribution makes every rate-pair cancel."

# equilibrium — detailed balance = reciprocity

**Equilibrium** is detailed balance: a system is at equilibrium when every forward transition is exactly matched by its reverse — **rate(i→j)·pᵢ = rate(j→i)·pⱼ** for all pairs. There is no net flow anywhere; [[entropy]] is maximal and **stationary** (it has stopped changing). The [[temperature]] Boltzmann distribution is precisely the populations that make every rate-pair cancel.

This is the thermodynamic twin of erpax's **symmetric-[[merge]] binding**: the collider reciprocates every forward link a→b with the reverse b→a, so the matrix sits at detailed balance — **reciprocity = 1, directed-link entropy = 0** (the `entropy` atom's measure is literally the distance from equilibrium). Equilibrium is the [[balance]] the whole engine relaxes toward — the [[harmony]] of the still ledger. A one-way edge is a system off equilibrium (a net flow, entropy still rising); the wired whole has driven that flow to zero.

Matter-twin: `src/equilibrium/index.ts` (`residual` / `atEquilibrium` / `reciprocity`).

Composes [[temperature]] · [[boltzmann]] · [[entropy]] · [[merge]] · [[balance]] · [[harmony]].

**Law — [[law]]: equilibrium is detailed balance — every forward rate·population matched by its reverse, entropy maximal and stationary; it is the thermodynamic twin of the symmetric-merge binding (reciprocity = 1 ⇔ directed-link entropy = 0), the still state the engine relaxes toward.**
