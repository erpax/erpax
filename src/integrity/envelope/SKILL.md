# integrity/envelope

Envelope encryption keyed by content-uuid — the at-rest companion to `SignedUuid<T>`.

Extracted from `integrity/envelope.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[integrity]].
