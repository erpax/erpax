# integrity/base64url — the encoding both signature paths implemented privately

`envelope` (HKDF-derived per-row DEKs) and `signatures` (JWS-shaped detached signatures) each
carried their own `b64urlEncode` / `b64urlDecode`. [[rules]]/copy hashed the decoders to one
address; the encoders are four lines and matched too.

This is the encoding on the wire for a **signature**. Two implementations of it is two chances
for the padding rule or the alphabet substitution to drift — and a signature that verifies under
one and fails under the other is indistinguishable, from the caller, from a signature that is
simply invalid. eIDAS-aligned containers and JWS both mandate the unpadded URL-safe alphabet
(**RFC 4648 §5**); it is a property of the format, not of either caller.

**Honest boundary.** This is the encoding only. It makes no cryptographic claim: the key
derivation, the algorithm choice and the verification logic stay in `envelope` and `signatures`,
and folding the codec proves nothing about either.

**Law — [[law]]: a wire format has one implementation. Two is two chances to disagree about a
signature, and the disagreement reads as an invalid signature rather than as a bug.**
