name: integrity
description: Use when verifying that a row's CURRENT bytes are the ones committed — content-uuid as a tamper detector (recompute ≠ stored ⇒ flagged), and the same canonical hash extended into signature, envelope encryption, and reference resolution.

# integrity — the uuid is the witness; the bytes cannot lie

FORM: **an object's id IS the SHA of its content, so any in-place edit recomputes to a different uuid.** This is Conservation Law 8: identity is *derivable*, never asserted. The Merkle history proves a transition happened in order; integrity proves the present state matches what that transition was supposed to produce — the two are complementary, neither alone sufficient. Detection is O(1) per row, even against a privileged admin running a raw `UPDATE`. Pure → testable.

- **compute / verify** — JCS-canonicalize the content (RFC 8785), SHA-256 it (FIPS 180-4), stamp it as a uuidv8 in a per-tenant namespace; `verifyContentUuid` recomputes and compares. `computeContentUuid`, `verifyContentUuid`.
- **lock a collection** — opt a collection in so every write recomputes its uuid; a mismatch fails the write at the [[hooks]] boundary. `tamperProofUuidField`, `tamperProofBeforeChangeHook`, `registerTamperProofCollection`.
- **reference by uuid** — relations point at the content-uuid, so a dangling or tampered target is a different id and surfaces, no cascade rules (Law 10). `resolveByUuid`, `findDanglingRefs`.

One canonical form yields one signable artefact: the signature attaches to the contentUuid (the hash), never to raw payload, so there is exactly one verification path (`signContentUuid`, `verifyContentUuidSignature`). The same hash keys envelope encryption — DEK = HKDF(tenantKEK, salt=contentUuid) — making confidentiality convergent and tamper-bound: any plaintext mutation changes the uuid, the DEK, and the AEAD tag at once (`encryptEnvelope`, `decryptEnvelope`). Because same content ⇒ same id, two instances holding the same row hold ONE row ([[merge]]); the check runs identically at line, document, and federation scale ([[fractal]]).

This is the CURRENT-STATE half of trust, [[duality]] to [[proof]] (the O(N) cost to audit) and to [[tamper/cost]] (the cost to forge): cheap to verify, ruinous to falsify. It is the executable spine under [[identity]] and the structural witness the [[society]] uses to lock its records, reading and recomputing from the filesystem alone ([[akashic]]). The standards it cites are external cryptography incorporated by reference (see [[standard]]).

## Standards

- **RFC 9562 §5.8 + RFC 8785 + ISO/IEC 10118 + NIST FIPS 180-4** — the content-uuid: JCS canonicalization, SHA-256 digest, uuidv8 layout. Second-preimage 2^256, collision 2^128.
- **ISO 19011:2018 §6.4.6 + SOX §404** — audit-evidence and internal-controls; row-level Byzantine tamper detection, every verification audit-trailed.
- **RFC 8032 EdDSA, RFC 7515 JWS, ETSI EN 319 132/142, eIDAS 910/2014** — the signature attaches to the contentUuid, one signable artefact, one verification path.
- **NIST SP 800-38D AES-GCM, RFC 5869 HKDF, ISO/IEC 27040, GDPR §32** — envelope encryption keyed by the contentUuid; convergent and tamper-bound.
