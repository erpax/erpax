# mcp — the agent gateway (configure it computed)

The MCP gateway is **the official `@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`**, wired in [[payload]] config — never a hand-rolled server. It exposes every collection as find/create/update/delete tools at `/api/mcp`.

## Configure — computed, not hand-listed

Feed it the barrel, not a list:

```ts
mcpPlugin({
  collections: Object.fromEntries(
    Object.values(allCollections).map((c) => [c.slug, { enabled: true }]),
  ),
})
```

It is the same `@/collections` barrel [[payload]] already registers, so a new [[atom]] auto-appears as tools — zero drift ([[generate]]). Custom tools (GW fusion, [[trust]]) are added via the plugin's mcp config; the per-key `scopes` field narrows a given key (the [[access]] cross collapsed to a compact capability set — see `@/plugins/mcp/scopes`).

## Auth — inherit, never widen

Bearer API-key auth runs each call in the key owner's `PayloadRequest`, so it **inherits the owner's [[access]] + multi-tenant scope** — the door never opens wider than the human behind the key. Every collection is added (the actor-merge — agent = human power) precisely because the [[access]] gate, not the tool list, is what keeps it safe.

MCP tool and resource URIs (`erpax://…`, `mcp://…/resources/…`) follow the computed path in [[path]] — they merge with [[fs]], [[github]], and [[api]] at one canonical atom path and entangle with erpax in all [[dimension]]s (content-[[uuid]] sealed).
