# aggregation

Use when computing summarized metrics — GROUP BY semantics, rollup/cube hierarchies, dimensional analysis, summary statistics (sum, count, avg, min, max, percentile), pre-computed aggregates vs on-demand queries.

Composes: [[calculate]] · [[queries]] · [[dimension]] · [[outlier]].

## Standards
- SQL GROUP BY / CUBE / ROLLUP (SQL:2016)
- OLAP

**Law — [[law]]: every summarized metric is fully derived from its grouped base rows, so an aggregate is a cache that must reproduce exactly from the underlying detail and never carries truth the rows do not.**
