# capture/media — test artifacts into [[media]]

The test-artifact uploader. It walks a Playwright `test-results` directory, reads its `manifest.json`, and for each test uploads the recorded video, its screenshots, and a generated WebVTT subtitle track into the [[media]] collection — returning the resulting Media ids grouped by test. `buildWebVtt` turns a sequence of `{title, ts}` steps into a valid `WEBVTT` body with monotonic `HH:MM:SS.mmm` cues, each cue running to the next step's offset and the final cue closing at `durationMs` (or a `start + 3s` floor). The uploaded artifacts become provenance-bearing [[audit]] evidence (ISO 19011:2018) that the captioned marketing pages can embed.

Matter-twin: `src/capture/media/index.ts` (`uploadTestArtifacts` · `buildWebVtt`).

**Law — [[law]]: every recorded test artifact becomes a [[media]] record, and every video carries a WebVTT track built from its step titles — captured evidence is always captioned and provenance-bearing.**
