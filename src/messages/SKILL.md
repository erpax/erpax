description: Use when sending or querying internal addressed messages between users — subject/body, priority (high/normal/low), multi-recipient addressing, threaded replies via parentMessage, optional attachment to invoices/customers/vendors/orders, and read-at tracking. The internal user-to-user messaging collection.

# messages

Messages — internal user-to-user messaging with threading.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners), co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here. One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Composition

The collection schema composes [[auth]] (access control via role-based grants), [[access]] (who can read/write/delete), [[fields]] (subject/body/priority/recipients/parentMessage/relatedDocument/readAt/status/audit), [[hooks]] (collection lifecycle mutations and side effects), and [[collections]] (the Payload collection framework). The thread-chain pattern (`parentMessage` replacing Rails `ancestry`) and multi-recipient addressing (`recipients` with join) are implemented via [[fields]] relationship types; ISO 8601 timestamps and audit-trail fields via [[fields]] base helpers.

## Standards
- [[standard]] ISO-8601-1:2019 date-time sent-read-timestamps
- [[standard]] ISO-27001 A.5.23 cloud-service-tenant-isolation
- [[standard]] ISO-19011:2018 audit-trail message-provenance
- [[standard]] GDPR Art 5(1)(e) storage-limitation retention

**Law — [[law]]: a message is one internal addressed communication between users — subject/body with priority and multi-recipient addressing, threaded by `parentMessage` (not a separate thread table) and tracked by read-at, gated by [[access]] so only sender and recipients may read it.**
