# graph — nodes and edges

A directed graph of nodes and edges: the **shape of the corpus itself**, where [[atom]]s are nodes and [[link]]s ([[links]]) are edges. `neighbors` gives the direct successors; `reachable` is the breadth-first transitive closure from a node. Pure, derived entirely from the edge list.

Its quantum facet, `quantum/graph`, reads the edges as [[entanglement]]: entanglement is symmetric, so a whole corpus reciprocates every edge in both directions.

Matter-twin: `src/graph/index.ts` (`graph` · `neighbors` · `reachable`). Composes [[node]] · [[link]] · [[matrix]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: a graph is the shape of the corpus itself — [[atom]]s as nodes, [[links]] as edges; neighbors and breadth-first reachability derived purely from the edge list, the [[quantum]] facet reading the edges as [[entanglement]].**
