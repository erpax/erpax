# component

Use when defining a reusable UI building block — button, card, modal, form field, input. The atomic UI element with consistent design, behavior, and accessibility.

Composes: [[accessibility]] · [[theme]] · [[design]] · [[standard]] · [[pixel]] · [[atom]].

A component is an [[atom]] rendered as a reusable on-screen unit, so its visible identity is its content-[[uuid]] [[pixel]]: `componentPixel(uuid) = pixel(uuid)`. Matter-twin `src/component/index.ts` (`componentPixel` · `sameComponent`) reads the look off the identity — never hand-styles it.

## Standards
- design-system pattern libraries
- WAI-ARIA for semantics

**Law — [[law]]: a component is an atom rendered as a reusable unit, so its visible identity is exactly its content-uuid pixel; two components built from the same content are the same component on screen (sameComponent), because render is read off identity, never assigned.**

@audit a component's render is its atom-uuid pixel (via [[pixel]]) — computed, deterministic, never hand-styled
@standard WAI-ARIA semantics on a render whose identity is the content-uuid
