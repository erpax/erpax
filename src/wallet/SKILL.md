# wallet — holds value

A wallet **holds value**: a [[balance]] under an owner [[identity]]. In erpax value is **double-entry** ([[entry]]) and content-addressed, so a wallet's state is **tamper-evident** — the [[quantum]]/wallet facet gives it a state content-uuid (any balance change → new uuid) and a balanced transfer. `credit`/`debit` are pure (return a new wallet). Composes [[balance]] · [[identity]] · [[money]] · [[account]] · [[quantum]].

Matter-twin: `src/wallet/index.ts` (`Wallet` · `wallet` · `credit` · `debit`).

@standard double-entry ([[entry]]); content-addressed state ([[uuid]])
