# lots — the production order (the funnel head, derived-state on the horo ring)

A `lot` is a production run against a sales `order` for a `product`. It is the **containing axis** of the routing graph ([[coordinate]]): it fans out into [[lotvariants]] (the size/colour roll-up) and is produced through an ordered chain of [[lotworkphases]] (the routing) that cross to the [[workphases]] catalog. The lot is one materialization of the universal [[entry]] law — its unit funnel is a chain of balanced counters (give·take at each stage), and its total IS the sum of its variants ([[accounting]] double-entry, [[balance]]).

## The state is DERIVED, never stored (the data-truth)
In 20 years of etrima production (N=11 759) the `status` column is **100% NULL**. State was always *computed* from lifecycle watermark high-water marks. So `status` is a **derived `horoStateField`** ([[horo]]) — `deriveLotState` (beforeChange) reads the furthest watermark reached and writes the band:

| ring | band | code | watermark | etrima coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 base | opened | `opened` | (created) | 100% |
| 2 share | confirmed | `confirmed` | `confirmedAt` | 21.5% (2 530) |
| 4 weave | producing | `producing` | `startedAt` | 1.0% (112) |
| 8 crest | finished | `finished` | `finishedAt` | 9.0% (1 053) |
| 7 descent | shipped | `shipped` | `unitsShipped > 0` | — |
| 5 round | delivered | `delivered` | `unitsDelivered > 0` | — |
| 9 unity | closed | `closed` | `closedAt` | **89.3% (10 497)** — the dominant terminal |

`canceled` (`canceledAt`, 1.2%) is the **off-ring** terminal — an escape from the ring, recorded as its own watermark, never a horo band. `tech_confirmed_at` was **0/11 759** — a dead column, dropped.

## The invariants (data-verified, encoded as `@invariant` + hooks)
- **derived-state** — `status` is computed from watermarks, never stored (100% NULL in etrima). `deriveLotState`.
- **roll-up** — `units = Σ variant.units` (100%, 11 636/11 636); likewise `unitsProduced`. The lot IS the sum of its parts ([[balance]]).
- **funnel** — `ordered ≥ units ≥ produced ≥ packed ≥ shipped ≥ delivered ≥ invoiced` (monotonic). Kept as double-entry [[accounting]] numbers.

## The coordinate cross
`lot` = the axis; `order`→`sales-orders` (demand) ⊕ `product`→`items` (catalog) are the up-references; the [[lotvariants]] and [[lotworkphases]] children are the down-references. The whole routing graph folds to the lot. `kind` is the free product/programme code (`SHIMA_07`, `CONF_21`) — open text, 20 yrs of real codes, never a closed enum (generic-naming law).

Matter-twin: `src/lots/index.ts`. Composes [[horo]] · [[coordinate]] · [[accounting]] · [[balance]] · [[lotvariants]] · [[lotworkphases]] · [[workphases]].
