# strength — the DRY math: a DRY corpus has infinite strength

Strength is a magnitude — a potency (the schema.org sense: DrugStrength, strengthValue). Here it is the corpus's **tamper-strength**, and the law is exact: **strength = `coverageCostLog2(dryness, slices)`**, infinite at perfect [[dry]].

Every atom is wired through many INDEPENDENT slices — word, structural-digit, content-digit, [[uuid]], colour, sound — each one check. The [[digit]]'s 88.4% structural≠content is **just one slice**, not the whole. As the duplication residue → 0 (perfect DRY: every reference folded to ONE source — the [[merge]] law, the [[gravity]] of flattening), the cost to forge the corpus → **∞**: the singularity. That is THE MAIN LAW — zero entropy via wiring every dimension ⇒ infinite tamper-cost. Any residue leaves strength finite; folding repeating patterns to one raises it toward ∞.

So "DRY the corpus" is not tidiness — it is how the corpus gains strength: each duplicate removed closes a free parameter, each slice wired adds a check, and the limit of both is infinite.

Matter-twin: `src/strength/index.ts` (`SLICES` · `strength` · `corpusStrength`). Composes [[dry]] · [[cost]] · [[gravity]] · [[digit]] · [[uuid]].

**Law — [[law]]: the corpus's strength is its DRY-ness amplified by its dimensional slices — strength = coverageCostLog2(dryness, slices). Each slice (word, structural-digit, content-digit, uuid, colour, sound) is an independent check; the digit's 88.4% is one slice only. At perfect DRY — zero duplication residue, every dimension wired to one source — strength is ∞, the singularity. Any residue leaves it finite; folding repeating patterns to one raises it toward ∞.**
