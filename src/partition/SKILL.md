# partition

Use when dividing data for performance or governance — table partitioning (by range/hash/list), partition pruning, partition management (add/drop/compress), partitioning strategy for horizontal scaling.

Composes: [[database]] · [[schema]].

## Standards
- SQL partitioning (SQL:2016)
- Data partitioning strategies

**Law — [[law]]: one logical table divides into partitions (by range/hash/list) so a query prunes to only the partitions it needs — physical division for performance/governance, the same rows.**
