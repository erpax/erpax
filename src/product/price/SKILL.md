# product/price — a price is asked for in a currency, never read from a hardcoded column

The ecommerce plugin generates one column per supported currency. `getProductPrice` resolves the
right one for the requested currency and `formatProductPrice` renders it, so application code
never names `priceInEUR` and never breaks when a tenant adds a currency.

Composes: [[law]].
