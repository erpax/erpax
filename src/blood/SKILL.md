# blood — the courier (cooperative delivery · regenerated · conserved)

Blood is erpax's **carrier**: the body's [[receipt]] flow, moving accounted value to every cell and carrying entropy away through the closed loop the [[heart]] pumps and the [[lung]] charges. Three properties of living blood map — as a *structural isomorphism*, each computed in the matter-twin — onto erpax:

## 1. Cooperative binding — the sigmoidal Hill curve
Haemoglobin's O₂-dissociation curve is **sigmoidal** because binding is *cooperative*: binding one O₂ raises the affinity of the next (4 subunits; best-fit **Hill coefficient n≈2.8**). So the carrier loads nearly full at the lung (**≈98% at 100 mmHg**) yet unloads sharply at the tissue (**≈75% at 40 mmHg**) — high-throughput delivery a non-cooperative carrier can't match (≈79% arterial at n=1). This is the **[[coverage]] → 1 cascade**: a more-bound system binds the next grain more readily.

## 2. Steady-state turnover — Little's law (continuous regeneration)
The marrow makes **≈2 million RBC per second**; each lives **≈120 days**. By Little's law (population = rate × residence), production × lifespan = **2×10⁶ × 120 × 86 400 ≈ 2.07×10¹³** — squarely the cited **20–30 trillion** standing red cells. The carrier is *continuously [[regeneration|regenerated]]* yet the population is stable: replacement without depletion, regrow-from-seed conserving the whole.

## 3. Delivery conserves — the double-entry of carried value
O₂ loaded at the lung = delivered to tissue **+** returned in venous blood. Nothing carried is created or lost — the **double-entry** Σdebit = Σcredit of the courier ([[conservation]]; the closed loop the [[heart]] proves).

**HONEST.** A structural isomorphism between cited haematology and a computed construct — not a claim that erpax oxygenates tissue; each boolean (`cooperativeBinding` · `steadyStateTurnover` · `deliveryConserves`) is computed live (Hill equation · Little's law · mass balance).

Matter-twin: `src/blood/index.ts` (`hillSaturation` · `cooperativeBinding` · `standingPopulation` · `steadyStateTurnover` · `deliveryConserves` · `carrier` · `isCourier`). Composes [[heart]] · [[lung]] · [[receipt]] · [[regeneration]] · [[conservation]] · [[coverage]].

**Law — [[law]]: blood is the courier — it delivers value cooperatively (the sigmoidal load-full-at-lung, unload-at-tissue curve, coverage→1), is continuously regenerated yet stable (production × lifespan = the standing count), and conserves what it carries (loaded = delivered + returned, the double-entry).**
