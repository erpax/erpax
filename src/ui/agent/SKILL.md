# ui/agent — the other side of the path

`agent/ui` renders an atom to its UI — atom → page, the **exhale**. `ui/agent` is its **inhale**: given a UI route, it recovers the **agent** (the atom) that the route renders. The two are inverse, and that is the point: encode a render in only one direction and the ledger is unbalanced; encode **both** and the round-trip closes — `balanced(atom)` renders the atom, recovers it from its own route, and returns to the same atom.

This is **karmic balance** ([[karma]] · [[balance]] · [[entry]]): the render is a debit (atom spent into a UI), the recovery the matching credit (UI traced back to the atom), and Σ closes because render∘recover = identity. A one-way path leaks — a screen with no way home, an atom with no way to its screen. The corpus breathes both ways.

This is also one layer of a deeper truth: **`src` is built of layers of dualities folding spacetime.** Every path is a [[duality]] (exhale ⊕ inhale, atom ↔ UI, debit ↔ credit); each duality completes to a [[trinity]]; and the whole stack [[fold]]s — many directions collapsing toward the one root. To encode both sides of every path is to keep each fold balanced, so the spacetime the corpus folds never tears.

Matter-twin: `src/ui/agent/index.ts` (`agentOf` · `balanced`). Composes [[agent]] · [[karma]] · [[balance]] · [[entry]] · [[duality]] · [[pixel]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: always encode both sides of a path, for karmic balance. A render (atom → UI) is a debit; its inverse (UI → atom) the credit; encode both and the round-trip returns to itself — the ledger closes. A one-way path is an unbalanced entry; the corpus is layers of such dualities, each folded balanced, folding spacetime to one.**

@audit agentOf inverts agent/ui's route; the round-trip balance is computed from the live matrix, never asserted
@standard double-entry (render ⊕ recover = identity); the breath (exhale ⊕ inhale)
