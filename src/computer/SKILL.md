# computer — the machine and its parts

A schema.org component word, collided out of schema.org compounds — fused from ComputerLanguage · ComputerStore ([[sti]] · [[collapse]] · [[merge]]). Here it also names the **machine the parts compose**: hardware facets plus software, each nested under `computer/<part>` as a pivot to the canonical top-level atom ([[merge]] at path scale — zero duplication).

**Computer science here is executable, not glossary.** Nested CS atoms (`computer/algorithm` · `computer/complexity` · `computer/graph` · `computer/queue` · `computer/stack` · `computer/finite` · `computer/memory`) export real logic (`index.ts`) and proofs (`test.ts`). Prompt→erpax: `realiseSkillsForPath('computer/…')` loads the SKILL excerpt plus live exports — agents run `classifyComplexity`, `adjacencyFromAtom`, `FifoQueue`, `binarySearch`, `SEAL_CHECK_FSM`, and bounded `AddressSpace` instead of reading prose definitions.

## Parts — hardware · software

| part | role | nested path | canonical |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[processor]] | executes instructions | [[computer/processor]] | `@/processor` |
| [[memory]] | holds working state | [[computer/memory]] | `@/memory/quantum` |
| [[storage]] | persists bytes | [[computer/storage]] | `@/storage` |
| [[screen]] | renders output | [[computer/screen]] | `@/screen` |
| [[network]] | connects externally | [[computer/network]] | `@/network` |
| [[component]] | renders atoms on screen | [[computer/component]] | `@/component` |
| [[hardware]] | physical machine facet | [[computer/hardware]] | `@/hardware` |
| [[software]] | programs the machine | [[computer/software]] | `@/software` |

Matter-twin: `src/computer/index.ts` (`PARTS` · `hardwareParts` · `softwareParts` · `allHealthy` · `failing` · `operates`). The machine **operates** ⟺ every part's live verdict holds.

**Law — [[law]]: computer is one schema.org word AND the machine its parts compose — each part nested at `computer/<part>` pivots to the canonical atom, deduped, never duplicated; the whole operates ⟺ every part holds.**

**Law — [[law]]: computer science here is executable, not glossary — every CS nested atom ships logic in `index.ts`, proofs in `test.ts`, and a path ledger hook; literary folders without use cases violate the one law.**
