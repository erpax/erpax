# payable/discounts — the early-payment discount, priced as an annual rate

"2/10 Net 30" — 2% off if paid within 10 days, otherwise the full balance at 30. The
calculator prices that as an ANNUALISED return, because the decision is not "is 2% worth it" but
"is 2% over 20 days better than what the cash earns elsewhere".

Stating it as a rate is the whole point: a discount quoted as a percentage of an invoice is not
comparable to anything, and a treasury decision made on the raw percentage is made on the wrong
number.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `discounts.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[payable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[payable]] · [[law]].
