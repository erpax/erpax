# payable/workflow — the bill lifecycle as a directed graph, not a free-text field

A bill moves through a fixed set of states, and only along edges the graph allows.

`draft → received → approved → scheduled → partial | paid | disputed`

A status field with no transition rule is a text box that happens to hold words. As a graph, a
transition either exists or it does not, and "approved" cannot be reached without passing the step
that means someone approved it — which is the segregation-of-duties claim the A/P control rests on.

`approved` is also where a bill becomes LIVE for event purposes, which is the one status the A/R
side has no equivalent of ([[invoices]]/hooks/transition).

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `workflow.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[payable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[payable]] · [[law]].
