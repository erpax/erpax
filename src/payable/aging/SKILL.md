# payable/aging — the A/P side of one bucket calculation

Wraps [[party]]/aging with A/P-shaped output — `bills`, `APAgingReport` — and adds the
cash-flow-impact section the payables side needs and the receivables side does not.

The bucket MATH is shared; only the naming and the cash-flow view differ. That is deliberate: an
aging bucket is the same arithmetic whichever direction the money runs, and duplicating it would be
two chances to disagree about what "60 days overdue" means ([[rules]]/copy).

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `aging.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[payable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[payable]] · [[law]].

## Standards

- **US-GAAP ASC-405** — liabilities.
