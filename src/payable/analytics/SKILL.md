# payable/analytics — vendor performance, DPO and spend

Days Payable Outstanding, vendor performance and spend analysis over the bill set.

DPO is the A/P mirror of DSO ([[receivable]]/analytics): the same shape asked of the other side of
the ledger. Neither is folded into the other, because the denominators differ — purchases versus
revenue — and a shared function would have to take that difference as a parameter anyway.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `analytics.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[payable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[payable]] · [[law]].

## Standards
