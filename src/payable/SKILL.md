# payable — the singular the `payables` collection is a set of

The A/P field factories: the shapes a bill carries — bill number, vendor, due date, payment terms,
A/P analysis. `payables` (the type module) is a set of these; this atom is the one.

That pairing is not decoration. [[balance]] reads the corpus as a double entry — a plural atom is a
COLLECTION and its singular is the MODEL, and a plural with no singular is a store with no type.
This atom held `index.ts` and `test.ts` and **no SKILL.md**, so the [[matrix]] could not see it —
and `payables` therefore read as an orphan for as long as both existed. The code was there; the
address was not.

A bill is the A/P mirror of an invoice ([[receivable]]), and the two field sets are deliberately
NOT one: a bill becomes live on **approval**, an invoice on **issue**, and folding that difference
away is how the AR/AP hooks broke once already ([[invoices]]/hooks/transition).

**Honest boundary.** These are field FACTORIES — shapes, not behaviour. What a bill means when
posted lives in the GL hooks; what it owes lives in `aging.service`. This atom claims the EN-16931
and ASC-405 shapes it declares, and nothing about whether a caller assembles them correctly.

**Law — [[law]]: a plural atom is a collection and its singular is the model. An atom with matter
and no SKILL is invisible to the fold, and its plural reads as a store with no type.**

## Standards

- **ISO-4217:2015** — currency codes.
- **US-GAAP ASC-405** — liabilities.
