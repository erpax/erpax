# wave/scheduler — policy becomes a schedule

The scheduler is the seam where a **policy** ([[wave]]/policy) becomes a **partition**
([[wave]]/load). `corpusWaveOptsFromPolicy` carries the policy's unit ceiling through
untouched and derives items-per-wave from its **depth** — a deeper plan means smaller
waves — so the ceilings live in one place and every schedule inherits them.

`scheduleCorpusPathsInWaves` then walks the live path set and balances it;
`corpusWaveOptsLiteraryPriority` weights by import position so heavily-depended-on
matter is scheduled first, without changing the policy's ceilings.

**Honest boundary.** Its tests pin the DERIVATION — that the policy actually reaches
the schedule — not the resulting wave count, which depends on whatever the corpus
contains today. Asserting a count here would make the test a hostage to the tree, and
a test that must be edited whenever the corpus grows is a test nobody trusts.

Composes: [[wave]] · [[wave]]/policy · [[wave]]/load · [[path]].
