# wave/policy — the ceilings, decided once

A wave schedule needs limits: how many units may sit in one wave, how deep the plan
may go, and what tamper-cost a wave must clear to be worth chaining. `maxWorkTamperPolicy()`
is the **one** place those are decided.

That matters because the alternative is each scheduler inventing its own numbers, and
then no one can say what the system's actual bound is — the corpus's recurring defect
in miniature: a constant duplicated is a constant nobody controls ([[rules]]). The
scheduler derives its options **from** the policy ([[wave]]/scheduler), so changing
the ceiling changes every schedule rather than one of them.

**Honest boundary.** The policy states ceilings; it does not prove they are the right
ceilings. They are declared in the open so they can be argued with — a tuned number
wearing a theorem's clothes is the thing this corpus refuses.

Composes: [[wave]] · [[wave]]/scheduler · [[tamper]].
