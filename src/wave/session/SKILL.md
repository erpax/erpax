# wave/session — readiness is earned, not assumed

A session walks a wave plan one hop at a time and emits a **uuid-chained receipt** per
completed wave: the first links to `GENESIS`, each addresses its own payload, and a
different actor produces a different address. The actor is therefore **evidence you
can verify**, not a plaintext label anyone could write.

The property that matters is negative: `isWaveSessionReady` is `false` until **every**
wave has actually been completed. A partially-walked plan reporting ready would be a
receipt for work never done — the exact shape of claim this corpus exists to refuse
([[rules]]/refutable). Completing the same wave twice does not invent progress either.

An **empty** plan is trivially complete and balanced, which is the honest answer: there
was nothing to walk.

**Honest boundary.** A receipt proves a hop was recorded, with what payload and in what
order — never that the work inside the wave was done correctly. It is a chain of
custody, not an audit of the contents.

Composes: [[wave]] · [[wave]]/load · [[audit]] · [[identity]].
