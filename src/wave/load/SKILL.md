# wave/load — the partition that balances

`selfBalancingWaveLoad` distributes items across the horo phases so that the spread
between the fullest and emptiest wave stays within one item. Balance is the point: a
wave plan whose phases differ wildly is a schedule in name only — the longest wave
sets the wall clock, and everything else idles.

Weighting is by **comparable units** (`pathComparableUnits`), never raw item count,
because two paths are not equal work. `laneCostAt`, `laneCostSplit` and
`laneSpeedupCeiling` are the arithmetic that says what a partition actually buys, and
`tamperCostForWave` is what [[wave]]/session chains its receipts against.

**Honest boundary.** A balanced partition proves the WORK is evenly divided by the
weight function it was given — never that the weight function models the real cost.
A wrong `weightOf` produces a perfectly balanced, perfectly wrong plan.

Composes: [[wave]] · [[wave]]/horo · [[path]].
