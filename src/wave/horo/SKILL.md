description: "Use when placing a wave on the horo ring — maps a 1-based ordinal onto the seven-position ring, content-addresses a wave from its features so identical plans fold to the same digest, and composes waves into a single resting step. UNITY is 9, the point a closing wave lands on."

# wave/horo — where a wave sits on the ring

A wave is not a bag of work with a number stapled to it. It sits on the **horo ring**,
and two things follow from that:

- **The ordinal wraps.** `waveStep(n)` maps a 1-based ordinal onto `HORO_DIGITS`, so
  the eighth wave returns to the first position. A plan longer than the ring does not
  run off the end; it comes back round. A non-positive or `NaN` ordinal resolves to
  the ring start rather than producing a step that is not on the ring at all.
- **A wave is content-addressed.** `wave(features, ordinal)` folds each feature to a
  uuid and merges them into one digest, so two plans built from the same features
  address identically and an empty wave has **no** digest — there is nothing to
  address. That is the corpus's own law pointed at scheduling: same content, same
  address ([[identity]]).

`composeWaves` reduces a run of waves to a single resting step, and `isClosingWave`
asks the only question that matters at the end: did it land on **UNITY**?

**Honest boundary.** This proves where a wave sits and how it addresses, never that
the work inside it is right or that the plan is well-balanced — balance is
[[wave]]/load's property, and the receipt trail is [[wave]]/session's.

Composes: [[wave]] · [[horo]] · [[identity]].
