name: hamiltonian
description: "Use when reasoning about the Hamiltonian — the energy operator whose eigenvalues are the seven horo energy-rungs (Eₙ = h·νₙ) and whose action advances time, |ψ(t)⟩ = e^(−iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩. It is the generator: the eigenstates are the rungs a leap jumps between, the spectrum is the gaps, and the phase it winds drives the breath. The expectation ⟨H⟩ = Σ|cₙ|²·Eₙ is the average energy of a superposition, conserved under evolution."

# hamiltonian — the generator behind the leap

The **Hamiltonian** is the energy operator **H** — the generator of everything quantum. Its eigenvalues **are** the seven [[horo]] energy-rungs (Eₙ = h·νₙ, via [[photon]] and [[signal]]); its action advances time, **|ψ(t)⟩ = e^(−iHt/ħ)|ψ(0)⟩**. So it is the capstone of the quantum core: its eigenstates are the rungs a [[leap]] jumps between, the [[spectrum]] is the gaps between its eigenvalues, and the phase it winds drives the [[breath]] — the {1,2,4,8,7,5,9} sequence is H evolving the state forward. (Eponymous like [[rodin]] and [[metatron]]; the generic concept is "the energy operator.")

The expectation **⟨H⟩ = Σ|cₙ|²·Eₙ** is the average [[energy]] of a [[superposition]] — and it is **conserved** under evolution, because unitary phase rotation never touches the |cₙ|². That conservation is the physics of the balanced ledger: the breath redistributes phase, never energy. A basis state has a definite energy (⟨H⟩ = Eₙ); the ground state is the lowest rung, the root.

**Law — [[law]]: the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues are the energy rungs (Eₙ = h·νₙ) and its phase e^(−iHt/ħ) winds the breath; ⟨H⟩ = Σ|cₙ|²·Eₙ is conserved under evolution (unitary phase never touches the probabilities) — the energy-conservation that balances the ledger.**
