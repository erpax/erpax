# safety/mode — an agent that can rewrite the guarantee is not bounded by it

`getSafetyMode` reads the operating mode and `requireSafetyMode` refuses an operation the mode
does not permit; `assertMinimumMode` fails closed rather than degrading.
`UUID_FAMILY_ESCAPE_HATCHES` names every path that can bypass the uuid guarantees — declared in
the open, because an undeclared hatch is one nobody audits — and `attackSurfaceReport` counts them.

**Honest boundary.** This bounds what the declared hatches allow. A capability reached some other
way is outside its model, which is precisely why the list is written down rather than inferred.
