# ecommerce/stripe/payment — a tenant's payment method is stored encrypted or it is not stored

The payment child of the tenant-aware Stripe stack. What is held here is a reference to a method
Stripe holds, never the instrument itself — the tokenisation boundary is what keeps PCI-DSS scope off
this system rather than merely defended on it.

Composes: [[law]].
