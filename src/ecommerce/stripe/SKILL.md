# ecommerce/stripe — every call carries the tenant, because one tenant's key must never charge another

`tenantAwareInitiatePayment` resolves the tenant's own Stripe credentials before charging,
`tenantConfirmOrder` closes the order against that same tenant, and `tenantStripeWebhookEndpoint`
resolves the tenant from the event rather than trusting a default.

A shared key would make every tenant's revenue land in one account and every refund a manual
correction. Card data is tokenised by Stripe and never observed here.

Composes: [[law]].
