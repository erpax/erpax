# ecommerce — the storefront, configured into the society

This organ is **not** an ecommerce engine — it is the thin erpax **configuration** of the official `@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce` ([[plugins]]; the [[collapse]] law — adopt the official plugin, override only what erpax demands). `createEcommercePlugin` is the single composition point; everything else is an override or predicate it injects. The storefront is the front-of-house face of the same transactional flow [[commerce]] models — `cart → order → payment`, one canonical currency (EUR), guest carts, tracked inventory.

Three erpax demands ride on the plugin defaults. **(1) Per-tenant Stripe** — there is no house Stripe account; each tenant supplies its own encrypted `stripeSecretKey` / `stripeWebhookSecret`, resolved from the cart's tenant at payment time, so PCI scope stays minimal (Stripe tokenizes — erpax never sees card data; ISO-27001 A.5.23 tenant isolation). **(2) Access predicates** — `isAdmin` / `isCustomer` / `isDocumentOwner` decide who reads a cart/order/address (the owning customer, or staff); the [[access]] cross over the same rows. **(3) The order-to-GL bridge** — the `orders` override fires `emitOrderLifecycleEvents` ([[hooks]] `afterChange`), mapping every status transition to a domain event so the GL posts the IFRS-15 / ASC-606 revenue + COGS double-entry ([[accounting]]). That hook closes the **"data is money"** gap: a sale front-of-house becomes a journal entry, keyed by content-[[identity]], never by the local row id.

Address rows also gain accounting master-data (tax regime, GL accounts) and per-country format validation; products carry checkout stock validation (`validateProductCheckout`).

Matter-twin: `configureEcommercePlugin/index.ts` (the composition root), `createTenantStripePaymentMethod/` + `stripe/*` (per-tenant initiate/confirm/webhook), `access/*` (the predicates), `hooks/emitOrderLifecycleEvents.ts` (the GL seam), `productValidation/index.ts`.
Composes [[plugins]] · [[commerce]] · [[accounting]] · [[access]] · [[hooks]] · [[identity]] · [[collapse]] · [[config]] · [[transaction]] · [[tax]].

**Law — [[law]]: "data is money" — every storefront sale becomes a GL double-entry keyed by content-[[identity]], never the local row id; erpax only configures the official plugin, overriding solely the per-tenant Stripe, access predicates, and the order-to-GL bridge.**
