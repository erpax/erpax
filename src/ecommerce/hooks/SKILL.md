# ecommerce/hooks — an order's lifecycle is announced where the order changes

`emitOrderLifecycleEvents` publishes the order's transitions from the collection, so an order moved
by the storefront, the admin panel or a job emits the same event. Emitting from the caller instead
means every new caller is a new place the event can be forgotten.
