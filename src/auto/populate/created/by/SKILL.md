# auto/populate/created/by — authorship attribution on create

A Payload `beforeChange` [[hooks]] that records WHO authored a row, server-side, at the moment of creation. It writes `data.createdBy = req.user.id` only when the operation is `create`, a request user exists, and `createdBy` is not already set — so client-supplied authorship can never be trusted or overwritten. The companion to the tenant auto-populate, it is the [[audit]] trail's authorship leg.

Matter-twin: `src/auto/populate/created/by/index.ts` — `autoPopulateCreatedBy` (a `CollectionBeforeChangeHook`). One of the [[auto]]-populate control gates ([[hooks]]).

**Law — [[law]]: authorship is stamped by the server, never the client — `createdBy` is set once, only on create, only from the request [[user]], and only when absent, so the [[audit]] trail's author cannot be forged.**
