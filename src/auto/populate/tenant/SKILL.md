# auto/populate/tenant — tenant isolation from the request user

A Payload `beforeValidate` [[hooks]] that pins a row to the writer's tenant. When a request [[user]] is present, it reads the first entry of the canonical `req.user.tenants[]` shape and, if that tenant reference is neither undefined nor null, writes it onto `data.tenant` — so a row cannot be created against a tenant the writer does not occupy. The legacy `autoPopulateHost` alias is fully retired in favour of the canonical [[tenant]] term.

Matter-twin: `src/auto/populate/tenant/index.ts` — `autoPopulateTenant` (a `CollectionBeforeValidateHook`). One of the [[auto]]-populate control gates ([[hooks]]).

**Law — [[law]]: a row's [[tenant]] is derived from the request [[user]], not the client — the first `req.user.tenants[]` reference is stamped onto the data before validation, the seam of cloud-tenant isolation.**
