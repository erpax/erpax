# nullability

Use when deciding NULL semantics — nullable vs NOT NULL fields, NULL handling in queries (IS NULL, COALESCE, NVL), NULL in aggregates (SUM ignores NULL), NULL propagation in calculations, three-valued logic.

Composes: [[fields]] · [[queries]] · [[calculate]] · [[database]].

**Law — [[law]]: NULL is the absent value under three-valued logic — it propagates through calculations, is ignored by aggregates, and is testable only with IS NULL / COALESCE; a [[fields|field]] is nullable or NOT NULL, never silently coerced.**

## Standards
- SQL NULL semantics (ISO/IEC 9075)
- Three-valued logic
