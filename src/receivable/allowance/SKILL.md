# receivable/allowance — expected credit loss, estimated from the aging buckets

The allowance for doubtful accounts as an IFRS 9 §5.5 expected-credit-loss estimate driven
by the aging buckets: each bucket carries a loss rate, and the allowance is their weighted sum.

This is an ESTIMATE and the code says so. The rates are inputs, not derivations — a corpus that
computed them from its own history would be asserting a forecast as a measurement.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `allowance.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[receivable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[receivable]] · [[law]].
