# receivable/workflow — the invoice lifecycle as a directed graph

An invoice moves through a fixed set of states, and only along edges the graph allows.

`draft → issued → partial | paid | overdue | written_off`

The mirror of [[payable]]/workflow, and deliberately not the same graph: an invoice becomes live on
ISSUE and stays live through its grace period, where a bill becomes live on APPROVAL. Folding the
two lifecycles into one is what silently changed A/P behaviour once already
([[invoices]]/hooks/transition).

`written_off` is a terminal state that must be reachable only from an overdue one — a write-off of
something never issued is an entry with no counterpart.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `workflow.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[receivable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[receivable]] · [[law]].

## Standards
