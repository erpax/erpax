# receivable/analytics — DSO, turnover and collection effectiveness

Days Sales Outstanding, receivables turnover and the collection effectiveness index over
the invoice set — the A/R mirror of [[payable]]/analytics.

DSO answers "how long does cash take to arrive"; turnover answers "how many times over the period";
CEI answers "of what was collectable, how much did we collect". Three questions, deliberately not
one number, because a single "collections health" score hides which of the three moved.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `analytics.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[receivable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[receivable]] · [[law]].

## Standards

- **IFRS 15** — revenue from contracts with customers.
