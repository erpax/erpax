# receivable/aging — the A/R side of one bucket calculation

Wraps [[party]]/aging with A/R-shaped output — `invoices`, `ARAgingReport`. The bucket
math is identical to [[payable]]/aging; only the naming differs, and the two stay separate so each
side names its own documents rather than sharing a word that means neither.

**Why it is a child atom.** It was `aging.service.ts` beside the barrel. When [[receivable]] gained
the SKILL its code always warranted, that folder became an ATOM — and matter at an atom root is a
stray sibling ([[rules]]): only the trinity lives beside a barrel. Nesting it is the lawful form, and
the parent re-exports it, so no caller changed.

**Honest boundary.** This computes; it does not decide. The inputs — rates, terms, thresholds — are
given by the caller or the tenant, and nothing here validates that they are the right ones.

Composes: [[receivable]] · [[law]].

## Standards

- **IFRS 9 §5.5** — expected credit loss (the buckets this feeds).
