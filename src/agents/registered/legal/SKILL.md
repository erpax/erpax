# legal

The legal agent and the check that gates it. `agent` owns legal matters; `conflict` is the conflict-of-interest determination, and it lives beside the agent because it is a **precondition** of acting, not an afterthought — an agent that acts before clearing a conflict has already done the harm.

Composes: [[law]].
