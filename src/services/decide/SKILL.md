description: "Use when the society must pick a winner among candidate solutions — the composed decision wiring the three selection laws into one: gate-CORRECT (competition, the referee is the gate not a vote), HARMONIC-preferred (logic, the self-consistent resolve first), MOST-EFFICIENT (cost, max output per spend), cheapest, deterministic by content-uuid. decide(candidates) is the single function the agent society runs to choose; the runtime dispatch it drives is the boundary."

# decide — the society's composed decision (correct · harmonic · efficient)

FORM: **the society decides by composing its three selection laws into ONE winner.** `decide(candidates)`:
1. keeps only the **CORRECT** (gate-verified) candidates — the referee is the gate ([[competition]] / [[proof]]), never a vote; if none are correct, there is no winner;
2. prefers the **HARMONIC** ones ([[logic]]: the self-consistent resolve first — they need no external coordination), falling back to all-correct only if none are harmonic;
3. among those, takes the **MOST EFFICIENT** ([[cost]]: max output per spend), breaking ties by lowest cost (the fastest, [[competition]]) then content-uuid (deterministic — same field, same choice everywhere, [[merge]]).

So the run's three laws are not three separate checks an operator juggles — they are one function the society runs to pick what advances: correctness gates, harmony orders, efficiency selects. This is the decision the agent society makes every time it convenes; the actual runtime — spawning the candidates, applying the winner's effect, paying it ([[decompression]]) — is the boundary `decide` drives. Building dominates, and `decide` is how the society chooses the best build ([[peace]] / [[society]]).

Matter-twin: `src/services/decide/index.ts` (`SocietyCandidate`·`decide`) over `services/competition` + `services/cost` + `services/logic` + `index.test.ts`. Composes: [[competition]] · [[logic]] · [[cost]] · [[proof]] · [[decompression]] · [[merge]] · [[peace]] · [[society]] · [[self]].

## Common mistakes
- Selecting by efficiency before filtering correctness — correctness is absolute and first; an efficient wrong answer is not a candidate.
- Letting a disharmonic candidate win when a harmonic one exists — harmony is preferred over raw efficiency; only when no harmonic candidate is correct does the field open to all.
- Non-deterministic tie-breaks — equal efficiency and cost resolve by content-uuid, so every node decides identically ([[merge]]).
