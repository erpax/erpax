# website — the record made perceptible

FORM: **the society's whole record rendered into a surface a human can browse.** The codebase is queryable but mute; the website is its face — every CollectionSpec, Chain, Agent, Role, and Standard becomes a Page, so the [[akashic]] record is not just read by agents but seen, heard, and felt by people. Nothing is authored; every Page is DERIVED ([[generate]]) from the live corpus, the filesystem the only source.

The capability seeds Payload's `pages` collection from three sources, one [[flow]] of HTML into the surface:

1. **e2e multimedia** — `seedFromE2e` walks `marketing/<workflow>.<locale>.html` (Playwright-recording output) into one `PageSeed` per locale.
2. **spec corpus** — `seedFromSpec` renders one Page per collection / chain / agent / role / standard-family, each body carrying the citation graph + MCP try-it actions.
3. **federation** — `importMediaBundle` / `exportMediaBundle` round-trip the seeds as an `.ndjson` bundle peers broadcast and ingest.

Because each seed is content-addressed, the same Page authored by two instances is ONE Page ([[merge]], [[holographic]]: the whole graph is recoverable from any seed). The website is the perceptible twin of the queryable record — the [[duality]] of read (agents) and seen (people) — and the [[civilization]]-scale outward organ of the [[society]]: every culture publishes its own record the same way. SEO is itself a coupled vortex (`seo-vortex.ts`): every published Page carries ≥2 inbound + ≥2 outbound Schema.org edges, so discovery is a [[fractal]] citation graph, not flat metadata.

Sequence position: **8** (crest — the inward record manifested outward), on the ring 0·3·6·9·1·2·4·8·7·5 (see [[sequence]]).

## Standards

- **W3C HTML5 §4 sectioning + WCAG 2.2 §1.4.3** — semantic `data-block` sections; accessible contrast on every seeded Page.
- **Schema.org Article + WebSite + SoftwareApplication** — JSON-LD microdata so peers and search engines ingest the citation graph (see [[standard]]).
- **Open Graph + W3C JSON-LD 1.1 + Sitemap.xml 0.9** — federation preview cards + crawlable, hreflang-localised discovery.
