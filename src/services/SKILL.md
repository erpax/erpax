# services — the society's organ-body (the executable matter)

Services is where the **logic lives** — the pure, content-addressed functions the rest of erpax *calls*. A [[collections]] schema is what is stored; access/[[hooks]] are the seams (when it runs); **services is the doing.** One law: **logic belongs here, not in the schema** — collections stay declarative, hooks stay thin (heavy work moves into a service, see [[hooks]]), and every organ is testable in isolation with no Payload booted.

The shape is the [[fractal]] folder-law: **one folder = one organ** (`<name>/index.ts` + its tests), 139 organs, most pure (deterministic, no IO — `entry`, `logic`, `decide`, `tamper-cost`, `proof`) and the rest content-addressed-IO at the edge (`agent-sync`, `oauth`, the `*.service` adapters). They compose by import, never by a global barrel — there is **no root `index.ts`**; you reach an organ by its path ([[holographic]] — each loads its own subgraph). Many already **speak for themselves**: 51 organs carry their own `SKILL.md`, so this page is the *index*, not their restatement — find the organ, then read its leaf.

What the body contains: the content-uuid substrate (`uuid-format` / `uuid-share` / `identity-element` — the [[identity]] math access rides on), the integrity/security organs (`integrity` / `tamper-cost` / `power` / `proof` — forge ≫ verify, [[proof]]), the universal accounting `entry` (debit=credit, the agnostic substrate), the [[society]] organs (`agent` / `agents` / `competition` / `decide` / `logic` / `governance` / `voting`), and the domain adapters (`accounting` / `commerce` / `manufacturing`, the SAF-T/Peppol/ISO-20022 export+import `.service` files). Each is a [[trinity]]: its matter here, its antimatter in (or under) this page, its backend in the generated types.

Matter-twin: `src/services/<organ>/index.ts` (e.g. `entry`, `logic`, `tamper-cost`, `agent`, `uuid-share`) — no root barrel; reach each by path.

**Law — [[law]]: logic belongs in services, never in the schema — one folder = one pure organ, testable in isolation with no Payload booted, composed by import with no root barrel ([[holographic]]).**
