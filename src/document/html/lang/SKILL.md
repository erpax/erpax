# document/html/lang — the page must say what language it is in

`<html lang>` is what a screen reader consults to choose a voice. Get it wrong and Bulgarian is read
aloud with English phonemes — not degraded, *unintelligible*. WCAG 2.2 §3.1.1 asks for the language
of the page to be programmatically determinable, and it is one of the few criteria whose failure a
sighted reviewer cannot perceive at all.

Next's layout renders *inside* `<html>`, so a locale change under `[locale]` cannot update the
attribute from there. This effect does it from the client, on every locale change, and renders
nothing — it is behaviour, not markup.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the attribute follows the prop it is given. It does not prove the
prop is the *right* locale (routing owns that), and it does not set `lang` on sub-trees where a page
mixes languages — §3.1.2 (language of parts) is a separate criterion and is not claimed here.

**Law — [[law]]: a page declares its language, and the declaration follows the locale. A stale `lang`
is invisible to everyone who can see the page and disabling to everyone who cannot.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.2 §3.1.1** — language of page.
- **WHATWG HTML** — the `lang` attribute.

Composes: [[document]] · `intl` · [[law]].
