# verification

A schema.org component word, collided out of schema.org compounds — fused from verificationFactCheckingPolicy ([[sti]] · [[collapse]] · [[merge]]).

**Content-addressed verification.** A claim is proven by a token that IS the content's [[uuid]]: the verifier re-derives the uuid from the actual content and matches. Because the token is the content's identity, ANY change yields a new uuid, so the old token fails — **re-verification is required by architecture**, with no expiry to set or revocation to push (the content-addressed dual of ACME DNS-01, RFC 8555 §8.4). The domain application — publish the token in a DNS CNAME/TXT record — is `src/domain/verification` ([[domain]]).

Matter-twin: `src/verification/index.ts` (`token` · `verify` · `needsReverification`). Composes [[domain]] · [[uuid]] · [[proof]] · [[anchor]] · [[tamper]] · [[merge]].

Entangled with — [[fact]] · [[checking]] · [[policy]]

Attested in schema.org — verificationFactCheckingPolicy

**Law — [[law]]: verification is one schema.org word, content-addressed; the same word collides every schema.org term that contains it into one atom, deduped, never duplicated.**
