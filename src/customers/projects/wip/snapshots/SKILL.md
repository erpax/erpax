# wip-snapshots

WIP Snapshots — periodic Work-in-Progress valuation per project.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: each closed period freezes one immutable WIP valuation per project (cost-to-date, EAC, % complete, contract asset/liability) whose accrual JE balances — a sealed snapshot, never re-opened or recomputed.**
