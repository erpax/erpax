description: Use when tracking a customer-facing deliverable under IFRS-15 §35 over-time recognition — accumulating costs (labour via time-entries, materials via purchase-orders), measuring cost-to-cost or milestone progress, managing budget vs EAC, and closing WIP to revenue per the contract's recognition method. The IFRS-15 project anchor collection.

Projects — anchor for IFRS-15 §35 over-time revenue recognition.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: open WIP equals accumulated cost minus recognised revenue, and recognition tracks cost-to-cost progress bounded by the estimate-at-completion.**
