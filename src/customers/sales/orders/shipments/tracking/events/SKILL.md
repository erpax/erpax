Tracking Events — per-leg shipment status updates from carrier APIs.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: the event log is append-only, and the `delivered` event is the single point-in-time trigger that transfers control and recognises revenue exactly once.**
