# shipments

Shipments — fulfillment + carrier tracking.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (mirrors index.ts @standard — the instrument reads SKILL.md) -->
- `@standard ISO-8601-1:2019 date-time shipped-at delivered-at`
- `@standard EN-16931:2017 §BG-13 delivery-information`
- `@standard ISO-3166-1:2020 country-codes ship-from ship-to`

- ISO-8601-1:2019 date-time shipped-at delivered-at
- EN-16931:2017 §BG-13 delivery-information
- ISO-3166-1:2020 country-codes ship-from ship-to
- ISO-19011:2018 audit-trail fulfillment-evidence

**Law — [[law]]: a shipment dispatches only goods owed by its sales order, advances state monotonically picked→packed→shipped→delivered, and cannot be delivered before it is shipped.**
