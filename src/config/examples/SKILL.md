# config/examples — self-contained tenant templates

Concrete, business-model-agnostic seed configs that each conform to the `TenantConfig` contract: `courseBuilderConfig` (a course platform), `newsletterConfig` (a writer's newsletter, with a `null` = unlimited plan limit), and `marketplaceConfig` (a digital marketplace). Each is a complete tenant in one object — branding, subscription plans with feature limits, marketing homepage + pages, feature flags. They are templates, not the live config: an operator copies one and edits, proving the [[config]] shape seeds any business model with no code change. `getConfigByBusinessModel` looks one up by slug; `listExampleConfigs` returns them all.

Matter-twin: `src/config/examples/index.ts` (`courseBuilderConfig` ⊕ `newsletterConfig` · `marketplaceConfig` · `getConfigByBusinessModel` · `listExampleConfigs`, all typed by the `TenantConfig` from [[types]]). Composes [[config]] · [[types]].

**Law — [[law]]: every example tenant is a self-contained object that satisfies the one agnostic `TenantConfig` contract — the template seeds a working tenant by copy-and-edit, never by code change.**
