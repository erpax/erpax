# commerce/fulfillment — the fulfillment face of [[commerce]]

`index.ts` re-exports the parent barrel, so `@/commerce/fulfillment` offers exactly what `@/commerce`
offers today. **The matter has not moved yet**: this atom is the namespace a hub split named for
the delivery side of commerce — provisioning what a checkout bought, and its own `test.ts` pins the FACE so a caller importing through this path keeps
working while the extraction is finished.

Stated rather than dressed up: until the fulfillment matter is lifted out of the parent, this is a
namespaced view, not a separate implementation ([[rules]]/concentration — matter belongs in the
child, and here it still sits in the hub).

Composes: [[commerce]].
