# heros/low/impact — children OR rich text, and the type says exactly one

The quiet hero: a narrow column holding either rendered children or CMS rich text. Its type is a
discriminated union — `{ children }` **or** `{ richText }`, each forbidding the other with `never` —
so the two can never legitimately arrive together.

The runtime honours that with `children || richText`, and the ordering is the decision: a caller that
passes children is composing explicitly, and an explicit composition outranks CMS content. The proof
pins the precedence, because it is the kind of thing a later refactor flips without noticing —
nothing type-checks differently, and the page simply starts showing the other one.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the precedence and that either source alone renders. It makes no
claim about the rich-text pipeline (`rich/text`) or about layout.

**Law — [[law]]: where a type permits exactly one of two inputs, the runtime states which wins anyway.
A union enforced only at compile time is silent at runtime, and the losing branch disappears without
an error.**

Composes: `heros` · `rich/text` · [[law]].
