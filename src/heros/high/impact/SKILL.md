# heros/high/impact — a set of links is a LIST, and an empty set is no list at all

The full-bleed hero. It also **darkens the header on mount** — the hero paints white text over
its own dark field, and the header sits on top of it, so a header left in its light theme puts white
links on white. That is a side effect, which is why it is asserted rather than assumed.

Two things here are structure, not styling. The call-to-action links render as `<ul><li>` because
they **are** a set of siblings: a screen reader announces "list, 3 items" and lets a user step
through them, which a row of bare anchors cannot offer (WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1). And the list is guarded —
`links.length > 0` — because an empty `<ul>` is announced as "list, 0 items", a piece of furniture
with nothing in it.

Every part is optional, because every part comes from a CMS: rich text, media and links may each be
absent on a draft, and each absence must render nothing rather than an empty shell.

**Honest boundary.** The proof asserts the list structure, the empty-set guard, and that each optional
part is genuinely optional. It does not check the rendered link targets ([[link]]/component owns
those) nor the image pipeline ([[media]]), and it makes no claim about the visual design.

**Law — [[law]]: sibling links are marked up as a list, and an empty collection renders no container.
The relationship between items is information, and an empty list is furniture announced as content.**

## Standards
