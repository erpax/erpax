# erpax — the face that names the whole

The five providers each ship one capability: [[access]], [[accounting]], [[cloudflare]], [[commerce]], [[identity]]. This is the umbrella — what a reader installs to learn **where erpax is and how to enter it**, without cloning the corpus or booting the app.

The URL and the repo are the same orientation, so the wire is the entry: `wireFromRepoUrl` resolves the canonical repo to its skill entry **and the content-uuid that seals it**, so a consumer can verify the orientation they were handed is the one this corpus published. A url that is not erpax is REFUSED with a reason — an orientation pointing nowhere is worse than none.

It also states the two things a consumer is actually bound by: the one law, and the licence — **CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0, every path**, commercial terms via `license@erpax.com`. Stating them where the consumer meets them beats a LICENSE file they may never open.

**It ships no collection, no config, no app.** The licensed application stays private, and `scripts/assert-root-private.mjs` refuses any publish that would change that — this package is a face, not the thing.

**Honest boundary.** Installing it proves you can find and verify the corpus; it does not give you the corpus. The atoms are read from the repo, and the ND term means you may produce a modification but not share one.

Composes: [[skill]]/wire · [[erpax]]/api/surface · [[law]].
