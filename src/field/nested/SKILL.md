# field/nested — one dotted path, three private implementations

Payload groups nest, so a hook that must reach `bank.bankIban` walks a dotted path. Three atoms
wrote that walk for themselves, and body-hashing ([[rules]]/copy) proved two of them byte-identical:

| atom | what it had |
| --- | --- |
| `derive/country/from/iban` | `readPath` · `writePath` |
| `classify/tax/id` | `readPath` · `writePath` — the same bytes |
| `validate/address` | `readNested` — a third spelling, with one behaviour the others lacked |

That third one is why this fold is not cosmetic. `validate/address` passes an **empty path** to mean
*the document itself*; `''.split('.')` yields `['']`, so the other two would look up a field literally
named `''`, answer `undefined`, and a caller would read a **present address as absent**. Two of the
three implementations were silently wrong for an input the third depends on.

**Duplication is camouflage**: while the walk lived in three private corners, nothing could show
that one of them handled a case the others did not. The folded form is the superset, and the empty
path is pinned by a test rather than remembered.

**Honest boundary.** This folds the accessor, not the hooks: what each atom derives, and from which
field, stays its own. It proves the two bodies were identical and that the third's extra case now
holds for all callers — never that any caller passes the right path.

**Law — [[law]]: an accessor written three times is three chances to disagree, and the disagreement
is invisible from inside any one of them. One truth, one address.**

Composes: [[field]] · [[rules]]/copy · [[law]].
