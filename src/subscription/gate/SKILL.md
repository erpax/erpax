# subscription/gate — the plan decides access at the collection, not in the page that renders it

`requireSubscriptionPlan`, `checkFeatureAccess` and `getFeatureLimit` answer from the tenant's
subscription; `blockWriteIfSuspended` and `allowReadDenyWriteIfPastDue` encode what a lapsed
account may still do — read its own history, write nothing new.

Gating in the UI leaves the API open. These are access predicates, so the answer is the same
whichever door the request arrives at.

Composes: [[law]].
