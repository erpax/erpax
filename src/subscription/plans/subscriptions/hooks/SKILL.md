# subscription/plans/subscriptions/hooks — lifecycle events are emitted where the row changes

`emitLifecycleEvents` publishes the subscription's transitions and `encryptSensitiveFields`
protects its credentials on the way in. Both run at the collection, so a subscription changed by
any route — admin, API or job — emits the same event.

Composes: [[law]].
