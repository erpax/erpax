# media/products — the storefront's product collection, with its media handled at the collection

`ProductsCollection` is the Payload definition: the product's fields, its access rules, and the
hooks beside it that manage the images a product carries.

The media belongs to the product rather than to a gallery that references it, so deleting a
product does not leave an orphaned upload nothing can reach.

Composes: [[law]].
