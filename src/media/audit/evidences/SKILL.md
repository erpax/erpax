# audit-evidence

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards
- ISA-500 audit-evidence
- PCAOB AS-1105 audit-evidence
- ISO-19011:2018 evidence
