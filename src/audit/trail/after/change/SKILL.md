# audit/trail/after/change — the [[audit]] afterChange emitter

A factory that returns a Payload `afterChange` [[hooks]] bound to a collection slug. On every create/update it builds a canonical `AuditEntry` (per ISO 19011:2018 §6.4.6 — id, timestamp, operation, document, tenant, actor, status snapshot) and emits it on two channels: channel 1 is `req.payload.logger.info` for streaming aggregators, channel 2 is a durable `audit-events` row whose `rowHash` chains to the prior row's hash (a SHA-256 Merkle chain) so any later insert or mutation breaks the chain. The durable write is guarded — it only fires when both tenant and document ids are present, and a write failure logs loudly instead of blocking the source write. The hook always returns `doc`.

Matter-twin: `src/audit/trail/after/change/index.ts` (`auditTrailAfterChange`). Composes the [[audit]] entry shape from the standards module.

**Law — [[law]]: every write emits a canonical audit entry on two channels — a streaming log and a Merkle-chained durable row — and the source write is never blocked by an audit failure.**
