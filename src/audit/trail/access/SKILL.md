# audit/trail/access — who may touch the [[audit]] trail

The access predicates for the [[audit]] trail collection. Read is tenant-scoped: an unauthenticated request gets `false`, a super-[[admin]] gets `true` (all tenants), everyone else gets a `Where` constraint pinned to their own tenant. Create is super-admin-only (rows are written by [[hooks]] in system context, not by users). Update and delete are NEVER allowed — `auditTrailModifyDenied` returns `false` unconditionally, so the trail is append-only evidence.

Matter-twin: `src/audit/trail/access/index.ts` (`auditTrailRead` · `auditTrailCreate` · `auditTrailModifyDenied`). Composes super-[[admin]] detection and the tenant from the request context.

**Law — [[law]]: the audit trail is append-only — read is tenant-scoped (super-admin sees all), create is super-admin-only, and update/delete is denied outright so evidence can never be forged.**
