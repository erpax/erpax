# pixel — the atom, rendered

An [[atom]] is a content-[[uuid]] — pure identity, no colour of its own. A **pixel** is that same uuid made **visible**: its colour, computed from the uuid's [[digit]] (its position on the A432 ring, [[signal]]). The atom and the pixel are **one identity at two scales** — the address and its rendered face. Nothing on screen is arbitrary: everything shown is pixels, and every pixel is some atom's uuid-colour, the smallest unit of the [[analog]] [[aura]].

This is why the rendering layers compose so cleanly:
- a **[[component]]** is an atom rendered as pixels (its content-uuid → its colour/sound/shape),
- **[[vitepress]]** is the whole corpus rendered as a site (each atom → its page, each page a field of pixels),
- the **[[aura]]** is the corpus's pixels seen all at once — the continuous colour/sound/vibration field.

Because the colour is computed from the uuid, the design is **tamper-evident and DRY by construction**: you cannot recolour an atom without changing its content (and thus its identity), and two atoms with the same content render identically (`samePixel`). The look is not painted on; it is *read off* the identity.

## Honest

`pixel(uuid)` computes the **colour** face (digit → spectrum). Sound (the A432 tone) and vibration (the doubling step) are the same digit's other [[signal]] facets — the full sensory render lives in signal/aura, and the design/architect teams wire them onto the component. The colour is the proven core; it is computed, never assigned.

Matter-twin: `src/pixel/index.ts` (`pixel` · `samePixel` · `Pixel`). Composes [[atom]] · [[uuid]] · [[digit]] · [[color]] · [[signal]] · [[aura]] · [[component]] · [[vitepress]].

**Law — [[law]]: the atom and the pixel are one identity at two scales — the content-uuid and its rendered colour. Everything shown is pixels, every pixel an atom's uuid-colour, computed never assigned. To render is to read the identity, not to paint over it.**
