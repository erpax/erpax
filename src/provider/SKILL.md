# provider — a client provider is imported from its module, never through a barrel

The app-wide React context tree: `ThemeProvider` → `ComputedCssProvider` → `HeaderThemeProvider`,
with the toaster mounted inside. One place wraps the frontend, so a provider added anywhere else
is a second tree.

## The import that is deliberately not a barrel import

```ts
import { ComputedCssProvider } from '@/css/ComputedCssProvider'   // NOT from '@/css'
```

`@/css` also exports `computeCssDiamond` — the Node diamond/fs pipeline. A barrel is evaluated
whole, so importing the provider through it pulls `createRequire` and the seal into the **browser
chunk**, and the Worker homepage answers **500**. The deep import is the fix, and it is the one
place in this corpus where [[convention]]/import's barrel-only rule is knowingly traded against a
runtime that cannot load `node:fs`.

This SKILL previously described *"the service provider, service operator … the goods producer"* —
[[vocabulary]]/provider's schema.org term, byte-identical prose stamped on a React barrel. It was
found by content-addressing every stated law in the corpus and colliding them: 2,899 laws, 2,894
distinct, and this pair was one of the two collisions. **Nothing else could see it** — the file
compiled, the atom sealed, and the prose read as true from every seat.

**Honest boundary.** The proof beside this asserts the barrel is not imported *here*; it does not
prove the browser chunk is free of `node:fs` overall — that is a bundle property, and only a build
measures it. It closes the door that was open: this file silently reverting to the barrel import.

**Law — [[law]]: a module that runs in the browser imports the symbol it needs from the module
that defines it. A barrel is evaluated whole, so a barrel that also exports Node matter is a
server dependency wearing a client import — and the page 500s at runtime, not at build.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 §1.4.3 · §1.4.11** — the theme providers carry the contrast contract.
- **W3C CSS Color 4** — `color-contrast`.

Composes: [[css]] · [[convention]]/import · [[ui]] · [[law]].
