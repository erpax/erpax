# gl/accounts/period/end/adjustments/hooks/adjustment

Period-End Adjustment Posting Hook — fires GL on status → 'posted'.

Extracted from `gl/accounts/period/end/adjustments/hooks/adjustment.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[gl/accounts/period/end/adjustments]].
