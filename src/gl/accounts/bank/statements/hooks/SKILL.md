# gl/accounts/bank/statements/hooks — an imported statement announces itself so reconciliation can begin

`bankStatementImportedHook` fires when a statement lands, which is the event reconciliation waits on.
Polling for new statements instead would make the delay a property of the poll interval rather than
of the import.

Composes: [[law]].
