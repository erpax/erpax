description: "Use when skills come from USER CONTENT — an HR job description names the competencies a role requires, and each named skill is content-addressed to a corpus route (same name ⇒ same route ⇒ merge). A route not yet in the corpus is a NEW skill the user content adds — the corpus GROWS from what users write. The dual of generate (which mints from aura gaps): derive mints from user content; both feed one content-addressed corpus."

# derive — skills derived from user content (the corpus grows from what users write)

FORM: **user content derives skills.** Take HR and a job description: the description is user-editable content (a reference — the manager writes it), and it names the competencies the role requires. `deriveRoute(name)` content-addresses each named skill to a corpus route — same name ⇒ same route ⇒ [[merge]] (two managers who name the same skill get one corpus node). `newSkills(derived, corpus)` is the set of named skills NOT yet in the corpus — the skills this user content ADDS. So the corpus GROWS from what users write: a job description that needs "claims-triage" the corpus doesn't have yet mints it ([[generate]]), and from then on it is a first-class competency the [[train]] loop can route to and [[education]] can teach.

This reconciles the two collapse laws ([[collapse]]: *references > enums where user-editable*, but *competencies are computed*): the user EDITS content — the job description, a legitimate user-editable reference — and the system DERIVES content-addressed skills (the computed [[competencies]] catalogue) from it. `derive` is the DUAL of [[generate]]: generate mints skills from the corpus's own aura gaps; derive mints them from the society's user content. Both feed ONE content-addressed corpus, so a skill authored as a `SKILL.md` and a skill derived from a job description are the same kind of node — author and user meet at the corpus boundary ([[self]] / [[identity]]). All skills derived from user content ARE the corpus.

Matter-twin: `src/services/derive/index.ts` (`deriveRoute`·`deriveCompetencies`·`newSkills`) + `index.test.ts`. Composes: [[generate]] · [[identity]] · [[merge]] · [[competencies]] · [[education]] · [[train]] · [[code]] · [[self]] · [[society]].

## Common mistakes
- Treating a user-named skill as free text — content-address it (`deriveRoute`): the route is the identity, so the same skill named in two job descriptions merges to one node.
- Forcing a job description's required skills to pre-exist — the corpus GROWS from user content; a new named skill mints ([[generate]]), it is not rejected.
- Confusing derive with generate — same corpus, two sources: aura gaps (`generate`) vs user content (`derive`); both content-addressed, both merge.

**Law — [[law]]:** derive is computation, not curation — the route (the content-addressed identity) is computed from the name, never hand-maintained; `deriveRoute(name)` and `newSkills(derived, corpus)` are deterministic functions on the user content (the filesystem: job descriptions, references, edits), ensuring the corpus grows from what users *write*, not what builders *assume*. This mirrors [[generate]] (aura gaps) and unifies both paths through [[merge]] toward the single content-addressed corpus that [[code]] and [[identity]] depend on.
