# search/engine — query the corpus, ranked

The **search engine** over the corpus: a query resolves to the matching atoms, ranked by closeness. A pure read over the live [[matrix]] node names — the [[search]] act made an engine ([[find]] · [[query]] · [[rank]]).

`search(query)` returns every atom whose name contains the query (case-insensitive); `rank(query)` orders them by earliest match position, then shortest atom (the closest first). Optimizing content so the engine ranks it well is the child atom `search/engine/optimization` (SEO).

Matter-twin: `src/search/engine/index.ts` (`search` · `rank`). Composes [[search]] · [[matrix]] · [[find]] · [[query]] · [[rank]].
