# default — nothing defines a default; the default is by architecture

The schema.org word is `defaultValue` — a value to fall back to. The corpus inverts it: a **defined** default — `x || fallback`, `y ?? literal`, `param = value` — is an **assumption**, and an assumption is entropy, a free parameter an adversary can satisfy without touching the truth. So the corpus defines none. The value is already there, **by architecture**: a [[name]] hashes to its content-[[uuid]], the uuid reduces to its [[digit]], the path locates it. `architecturalDefault(name)` *derives* the identity; it does not assign it. There is nothing to default to, because the structure already decided.

This is why the [[collider]] has no default — its coverages are bounded [0,1] by construction and its atom count is positive by architecture, so no fallback is written. It is computed-not-hardcoded seen from the value's side: every value flows from the structure, never from a literal a human chose. `isByArchitecture(name, value)` holds only when the value equals what the architecture computes — proof it was derived, not defaulted.

Matter-twin: `src/default/index.ts` (`architecturalDefault` · `isByArchitecture`). Composes [[name]] · [[digit]] · [[uuid]] · [[collider]].

**Law — [[law]]: nothing defines a default — the default is by architecture. A defined default (a hardcoded fallback — `|| x`, `?? x`, `= literal`) is an assumption, hence entropy; the architecture (the content-uuid, the path, the computed structure) already determines the value, so derive it, never assign it. The collider has no default for exactly this reason — computed-not-hardcoded at every scale.**
