# default/lexical — one editor configuration, so a link means the same thing on every surface

`defaultLexical` is the base rich-text feature set every editable field shares, including the
link validation rules: an internal reference resolves against a collection, an external one
must be a valid URI.

Configuring the editor per field is how two surfaces end up disagreeing about what a link is.
