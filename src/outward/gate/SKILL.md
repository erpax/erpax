# outward/gate — the release half of the split, fail-closed

"Test all the APIs" is **two** questions, and conflating them makes a gate nobody
trusts:

| question | answer depends on | belongs in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| does OUR CODE handle the shape? | us — deterministic | **the gate. This.** |
| is the OUTSIDE still that shape? | someone else's uptime | a lane, run deliberately |

This runs the first one: **twelve offline contracts** — the EU four
([[outward]]/eu), the BG two ([[outward]]/bg), the world six ([[outward]]/world) —
against frozen captures on disk.

**Offline by construction, not by discipline.** It imports only the `*Offline`
functions, and its test runs the whole gate with `fetch` replaced by a throwing stub.
A network call cannot pass. That matters because the alternative already happened: a
perfectly correct erpax would have failed its release when the EU sanctions host
answered `403` — and that 403 later turned out to be *our* missing token, which is the
case **for** the split, not against it. The offline half kept the release honest while
the live half named the break.

## Three ways it fails a release, each a real defect

- **A parser disagrees with its own capture.** The shape erpax reads moved. This is
  erpax's break, not the world's, and the error says so.
- **A contracted endpoint matches no catalogued rail.** The ledger under-reporting
  itself — exactly how a working ECB contract marked *nothing* covered for as long as
  it existed ([[rules]]/unraised: a key nobody has fails OPEN).
- **Unproven claims grow.** A new rail declaring `clientImplemented` with no contract
  beside it is a promise nothing can contradict.

**Honest boundary.** A green gate proves erpax's parsers agree with **captures**, never
that an authority is up, correct, or still sending that shape — a fixture freezes a
moment. Only `erpax outward eu|bg|world --online` speaks to the present. And the
coverage ceiling is a **ratchet, not a target**: all 20 remaining unproven rails are
credentialed, so the floor is provisioning, not undone work.

**Law — [[law]]: the gate tests OUR code, never someone else's uptime. A release that
can be failed by a stranger's reboot teaches everyone to bypass it, and a bypassed
gate is prose.**
