# invariant — the architecture, enforced

The architecture invariants are the **executable form of the laws** — the matter-twin of the [[gate]]. Where the gate atom states *what verification is* (check · message · heal), this is the running `checks.ts` that **holds the corpus to the dissolution architecture** so a violation is a hard FAIL, never a warn (green means *"obeys the law"*, not *"compiles"*).

What it enforces (the [[sequence]] made strict):

- **single-word atoms, no grouping prefixes** — location is the derived word-path, not a `collections/`/`services/` container (dissolve).
- **every file is an atom or junk** — matter (`index.*`) ⊕ form (`SKILL.md`); what fits neither [[payload]] nor [[vitepress]] is purged.
- **locality + the ≥2-cross [[balance]]** — a folder communicates only through its [[coordinate]] cross (parent · prev · next); a non-neighbour link is a violation, and a folder with fewer than two crosses is unbalanced.
- **the naming matrix** — strict file names inside each folder (`index.ts` matter · `SKILL.md` form · reference fields · hook files); an off-matrix name is junk.

Each violation is content-addressed: its **message names the failing [[coordinate]]** (path · uuid · broken neighbour), so the same fault anywhere dedups to one verdict ([[merge]]) and folds into the matrix root (tamper-evident), renderable as [[aura]]. The check runs at `onInit` and in the test layer — the corpus proves its own shape.

Operational memory IS these invariants enforced on the live tree ([[memory/architecture]]) — the executable checks are what the lattice remembers, not a side store.
