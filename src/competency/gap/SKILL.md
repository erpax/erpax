# competency-gap — required − held, on the shared scale

The gap law: `gap = max(0, required − held)` per competency, met when `gap === 0`. One pure function (no I/O, no persistence — trivially testable, stateless) that scores a held competency set against a required set and returns per-line gaps plus `meetsAllMandatory` and a `matchScore` (fraction met, 1 when nothing is required).

The [[merge]] made executable: the SAME function scores a human hire against a job AND an AI agent against a task, because both are held-vs-required on the identical SFIA 1-7 [[standard]]. Human↔agent is one [[duality]] over a single measure; collapsing the prefix (`human`/`agent` competency → one competency) is the merge run on the naming axis. Each held/required line is a typed [[field]] pair (competency + proficiency); the competency set itself is read from [[collections]], scored here, the gap persisted in [[accounting]] (or routed) by the caller — never inside this leaf.

Sequence position **7** — a compute/measure surface (like the pure-form calculators), no state of its own.

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (mirrors index.ts @standard — the instrument reads SKILL.md) -->
- `@standard ISO 30405:2016 essential-vs-optional (mandatory gating)`


- **SFIA 8 responsibility-levels-1-7 (the shared held/required scale)** — both human and agent proficiency maps onto SFIA levels 1–7.
- **ISO 30405:2016 essential-vs-optional (mandatory gating)** — the `mandatory` flag gates a match; a mandatory gap > 0 blocks `meetsAllMandatory`.

## Common mistakes
- Making it a collection or letting it touch the DB — it is a pure function; persist only its *result*.
- Treating mandatory gaps as advisory — a mandatory line with `gap > 0` blocks the match (`meetsAllMandatory === false`).
- Inventing a second scale for agents — humans and agents share the one SFIA scale; that shared scale IS the merge.

**Law — [[law]]: the gap is the pure stateless function `max(0, required − held)` per competency, met only at zero, with any mandatory gap > 0 blocking the whole match — it computes, it never persists.**
