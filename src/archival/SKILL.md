# archival — long-term decentralized archival (defense-in-depth pinning)

Long-retention pinning for tenants under regulatory rules that outlive in-platform redundancy: pin the same content to EVERY listed backend (IPFS CID v1, Arweave pay-once, Filecoin storage proofs, R2-glacier) so that at least one survives. `pinForRetention` swallows per-backend failures and returns only the receipts that succeeded — the caller checks the length. Each receipt is addressed by the [[content]]-uuid and verified or recovered through its own backend.

Matter-twin: `src/archival/index.ts` — `pinForRetention` · `tenantPins` · `verifyPinning`; types `ArchiveBackendId` · `PinReceipt` · `ArchiveBackend`. Keys every pin by the [[integrity]] content-[[uuid]]; the long-horizon partner of in-platform [[archive]] [[retention]].

**Law — [[law]]: long-retention content is pinned to every backend for defense-in-depth — at least one must succeed, and a receipt verifies or recovers only through the backend that produced it.**
