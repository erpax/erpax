# blocks/code — the config and the client component both wanted the name `Code`

`config.ts` exports `Code` (the Payload block) and `Component.client.tsx` exports `Code` (the React
component). One barrel cannot offer both under one name, so the client is `CodeClient` here. The
collision is real and naming it is cheaper than renaming a file two surfaces import by path.

Composes: [[law]].
