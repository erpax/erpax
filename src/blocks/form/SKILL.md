# blocks/form — nine field types, and the registry that decides which one an editor gets

A CMS form is data: an editor picks field types, and something must turn each stored `blockType`
into a component. `fields` is that map, and it is the whole of this atom's authority.

**A map, not a switch.** The registry is a value, so a field type either has an entry or it does not
— and that is a fact anything can check, including a proof. A `switch` with a silent default hides
the same question inside control flow, where the unhandled case is discovered by an editor whose
field renders as nothing.

Nine entries: checkbox · country · email · message · number · select · state · text · textarea. Each
is its own atom carrying its own law, and each is proven where it lives — the label/control binding
that breaks silently, the checkbox whose value must be written by hand because a Radix control fires
no native event, the ISO-shaped country and state data, the width whose absence must not read as
zero.

`FormField` is the shared wrapper the single-line fields compose through, so the label, the required
marker and the error placement are written once rather than nine times.

**Honest boundary.** This atom is the registry and the wrapper. Every claim about an individual field
belongs to that field's atom. It also does not validate a submission — `react-hook-form` and the
server own that, and a field rendering correctly says nothing about what the server will accept.

**Law — [[law]]: a dispatch over editor-authored data is a registry, not a switch. A map can be
asked what it covers; a switch answers only when something already went wrong.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1 · §3.3.1 · §4.1.2** — carried, per field, by the atoms this registry names.

Composes: `blocks` · [[law]].
