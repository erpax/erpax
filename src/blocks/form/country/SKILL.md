# blocks/form/country — 245 codes that must each be a real ISO 3166-1 alpha-2

The control is the ordinary Radix combobox ([[blocks]]/form/select): a `<button role="combobox">`
whose only accessible name is the `<label htmlFor>` bound to its `id`. What makes this atom
different is that **it ships data**, and data is where a silent wrong answer lives.

A country code is not free text. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 fixes the shape — exactly two uppercase letters
— and a duplicate or a three-letter entry produces a form that submits a value no downstream system
recognises. Nothing on screen reveals it: the label reads fine, the option selects, and the failure
surfaces days later in a shipping address or a VAT determination.

So the proof is about the list, not the widget: **245 entries, every code two uppercase letters,
every code unique, every entry labelled.** That is checkable, and it is the property the rest of the
system relies on.

**Honest boundary.** This proves each code has the ISO *shape* and that the list is internally
consistent. It does not prove each code is *assigned* — a well-formed `XX` would pass — because the
authority for that is the ISO register and no copy of it lives here. Nor is it a claim about
completeness: 245 is what this list holds, not a statement that the register holds 245.

**Law — [[law]]: shipped reference data is checked against the standard that defines its shape. A
malformed country code looks exactly like a valid one in the form and fails somewhere else entirely,
so the list is proven where it is written.**

## Standards

- **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2** — two-letter country codes.
- **WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1 · §4.1.2** — label association; name, role, value.

Composes: [[blocks]]/form/select · [[identity]] · [[law]].
