# blocks/form/error — an invalid field always says why

A field that rejects input and explains nothing is a dead end: the user knows the form will not
submit and has no way to learn what to change. WCAG 2.2 §3.3.1 (error identification) asks for the
error to be *described in text*, and the failure this component forbids is the empty one — a
validator that fires with no `message`, leaving a red box containing nothing.

So the fallback is not decoration. `errors[name]?.message` is whatever the validator chose to say;
when it chose nothing, the translated `field-required` is said instead. **There is no input for
which this renders empty**, and that is the property worth proving.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the message is non-empty and comes from the field's own error. It
does not prove the message is *helpful* — "field-required" on a malformed email is technically true
and practically useless, and only a better validator message fixes that. It also does not wire the
error to the input via `aria-describedby`, so a screen reader reaching the field does not announce
it automatically; that is a real §3.3.1 gap and it is named here rather than implied away.

**Law — [[law]]: a rejected input is explained in text, always. A validator that fires without a
message leaves the user staring at a red box, so the component supplies the sentence the validator
omitted — and never renders nothing.**
