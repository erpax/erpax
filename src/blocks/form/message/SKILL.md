# blocks/form/message — content in a form, and it is not a field

Every other atom under [[blocks]]/form is a control: it has a name, a label, a value, and a place in
the tab order. This one is prose — a rich-text block placed between fields to explain what comes
next.

That difference is the whole design, and getting it wrong is a real accessibility defect: a message
given a label and an id would be announced as an unnamed, unfillable field, and a screen-reader user
would sit on it waiting to type. So it renders **no label, no control and no name** — it takes the
full width, because an explanation narrower than the fields it explains reads as a caption for one of
them.

**Honest boundary.** The proof asserts what this renders and, more usefully, what it does NOT render:
no form control appears. It does not validate the rich-text payload — `rich/text` owns that — and
an empty message renders nothing at all, which is correct and is pinned.

**Law — [[law]]: content inside a form must not look like a field. A control is anything with a name
and a value, so an explanation must have neither — otherwise the form announces a question it will
never accept an answer to.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1** — info and relationships: content is not a control.

Composes: [[blocks]] · `rich/text` · [[law]].
