# blocks/form/state — 50 subdivision codes, and the two-letter shape they must keep

The control is the ordinary Radix combobox ([[blocks]]/form/select), named only by its bound label.
The substance is the list: the fifty US states, each carrying the two-letter code that ISO 3166-2:US
and USPS both use.

Fifty is a fact, and it is the interesting one. A list that has quietly lost an entry looks
completely normal — the dropdown opens, the states are there, and the missing one is simply a state
nobody in that state can select. Nothing errors. So the count is asserted, alongside the shape and
the uniqueness that make each entry usable downstream.

**Honest boundary.** Fifty states is this list's scope and the proof pins it. That deliberately
excludes DC, Puerto Rico and the other territories — a form needing them needs a different list, and
this SKILL says so rather than letting a caller discover it from a missing option. As with
[[blocks]]/form/country, the shape is checked and *assignment* is not: a well-formed `XX` would pass,
because the register is not carried here.

**Law — [[law]]: a fixed-size reference list asserts its size. A silently truncated list produces a
form that works perfectly for everyone except the people it dropped.**

## Standards

- **ISO 3166-2:US** — subdivision codes for the United States.
- **WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1 · §4.1.2** — label association; name, role, value.

Composes: [[blocks]]/form/select · [[law]].
