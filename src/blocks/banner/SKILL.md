# blocks/banner — the block's shape and the block's rendering, named separately

`Banner` is the Payload definition and `BannerBlock` renders it. They are separate exports because
typegen and the server config need the shape without dragging React into a context that cannot run
it ([[blocks]]/config).

Composes: [[law]].
