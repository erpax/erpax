description: "Use when modelling shop-floor equipment mined from the upstream source of truth (etrima, 20 years of garment manufacturing) — the machine node of the production-traceability spine. Every machine carries a three-rate spread (pay ≤ cost ≤ price per hour) that is double-entry economics on the floor: machineRate decomposes a machine-hour into revenue = cost + margin and cost = pay + overhead. A machine runs a work/phase for a lot variant during a shift; fields are the real etrima columns, never invented."

# machine — the equipment node, mined from upstream

The first fold of the **upstream gap**: erpax had the governance/fiscal tiers but not the manufacturing operations spine. `machine` is the equipment node, taken from the real source of truth — etrima's 20-year production DB (101 machines · 172 machine_types).

The schema handed over the fold. Every machine carries **three real per-hour rates**:

- `payPerHour` — what labour running it is paid
- `costPerHour` — what the run truly costs (labour + overhead + wear)
- `pricePerHour` — what the order is charged

That is **double-entry economics on the shop floor**. `machineRate(rates, hours)` decomposes a machine-hour exactly:

`revenue = cost + margin` · `cost = pay + overhead`

— the same conservation the corpus books everywhere else ([[accounting]]), now on the floor. A machine-hour is Dr cost / Cr revenue; the margin is the sealed difference, and a loss machine surfaces a negative margin rather than hiding it.

Matter-twin: `src/machine/index.ts` — `machineRate` · `typeThroughput` · `MachineType` (the etrima classification: `machinesPerWorker`, per-minute economics). A machine runs a [[work]]/phase for a [[lots]] variant during a work-shift — the traceability **edges** (`lot_work_phase`, 291k rows) are the larger fold; this is the node they attach to.

**Honest boundary.** Fields are the *real etrima columns*, mined from the Rails source-of-truth — never invented. This is the node; the full spine (`work_phase → lot_work_phase → machine → work_shift`, plus variants and packing detail) is the ongoing upstream fold. The rate spread is exact arithmetic; the tie to double-entry is the corpus's own conservation law, not a metaphor.

**Law — [[law]]: a machine-hour is a spread, not a number — price = cost + margin, cost = pay + overhead — mined from the upstream source of truth and booked like every other entry. The equipment node of the traceability spine; the edges follow.**

## Standards

- **etrima (Rails source-of-truth)** — the real `machines` / `machine_types` schema; the mining directive is *always fold upstream*.
- **Double-entry** — the machine rate spread as a conserved Dr/Cr decomposition.

Composes: [[accounting]] · [[work]] · [[lots]] · [[law]].
