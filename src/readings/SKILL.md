# readings — device-collapsed snapshots feeding the analog stream

A **reading** is the moment [[quantum/device]] collapses continuous physiology into discrete numbers — capture on the edge, raw stream stays local, only scalars cross. Each reading is a content-addressed [[snapshot]] (`readingUuid`) that appends to the chain and folds into [[quantum/emr]] as an `EmrObservation` (`observationFromDeviceReading`). The EMR chain replays those observations as **[[analog]] results** — a continuous measured timeline ([[vital]] signs, labs, [[biometric]] captures) with supersede semantics, never binary on/off flags.

**Pipeline.** Continuous field → device collapse → reading snapshot → EMR observation → analog result stream (`analogResults` · `reconstructAt`). Matter-twin: `src/readings/index.ts` — `DeviceReading` · `readingBoundaryHolds` · `readingUuid`; `src/quantum/emr/index.ts` — `observationFromDeviceReading`.

**Law — [[law]]: a reading is a device-collapsed snapshot feeding the analog stream — content-addressed at the edge, append-only in the chain, replayed as continuous measured quantities with supersede semantics, never in-place mutation.**
