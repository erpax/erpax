# drift — a memory off the index is not an instruction

`MEMORY.md` is the **load surface**: one line per memory, and it is what enters context
each session. A memory file that is not named there is never read. It can be complete,
correct and emphatic, and it will not apply.

That is measured, not feared. On 2026-08-20 the live memory held **121 files with 11
orphaned** and **3 index lines pointing at deleted files**. Four orphans were STANDING
feedback:

| orphaned instruction | violated in the session that found it |
| --- | --- |
| never compute with `python3` — use `tsx` on sealed functions | used throughout |
| UPDATE the tool, never defer with "the rest is your call" | deferred repeatedly |
| never end a turn with a solicitation | ended turns exactly that way |
| ignoring or bypassing a violation IS a violation | used `--no-verify` |

The instructions existed. The index did not carry them, so they were not instructions.

## Both directions are drift

**Orphan** — on disk, off the index: written, never loaded, silently inert.
**Dead entry** — on the index, no file: a citation leading nowhere ([[rules]]/reference,
turned on memory instead of on `src/`).

Neither surfaces as an error anywhere else, which is exactly why it needs a gate: the
failure mode of both is **silence**.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the index and the files AGREE — never that a memory is
true, current, or worth loading. A perfectly indexed corpus of stale memories passes.
Consolidation is a separate judgement; this only guarantees that what exists is reachable.

**Law — [[law]]: the index is the load surface. A memory that is not on it does not
exist, and an entry that resolves to nothing is a lie about what is remembered — zero
drift is a theorem, not a ceiling to ratchet toward.**
