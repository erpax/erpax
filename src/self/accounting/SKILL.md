# self-accounting — erpax books itself (under [[self]])

FORM: **the erpax-platform tenant runs its own [[accounting]] through erpax.** [[revenue]] (IFRS-15 §31–§45, from Stripe), [[cost]]s (infra/payroll/supplier/tax), regulatory filings (FINREP · COREP · CSRD · IFRS-S1/S2 · VAT) and obligations are booked/scheduled, and `checkSelfAccountingComplete` (Conservation Law 26) asserts every revenue is booked, every filing filed by its due date, every obligation paid — surfacing the overdue tail. This is the literal double-[[entry]] gateway of the [[law]]: each booking posts a balanced entry (revenue ⊕ obligation, cost ⊕ filing), and balanced books = zero net [[entropy]].

Matter-twin: `src/self/accounting/index.ts` — `bookRevenue` · `bookCost` · `scheduleFiling` · `scheduleObligation` · `checkSelfAccountingComplete`.
Composes: [[self]] · [[accounting]] · [[entry]] · [[revenue]] · [[cost]] · [[standard]] · [[reconcile]] · [[balance]] · [[gate]] · [[law]].

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (mirrors index.ts @standard — the instrument reads SKILL.md) -->
- `@standard IFRS IFRS-15 §31-§45 (revenue recognition)`
- `@standard IFRS IAS-18 (deprecated, superseded by IFRS-15)`

- IFRS 15 §31–§45 (revenue recognition); EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC; EBA FINREP/COREP; CSRD 2022/2464 + ESRS
- Conservation Law 26 — self-accounting-complete

## Common mistakes
- Booking revenue without linking the GL journal entry — an unbooked revenue (`journalEntryId` unset) is an unbalanced post, counted by `checkSelfAccountingComplete`.
- Treating a missed filing/obligation as advisory — Law 26 makes overdue items a RED gate (the books don't balance until they are filed/paid).

**Law — [[gate]]** erpax's books must balance: every revenue booked, every filing filed by its due date, every obligation paid — or `checkSelfAccountingComplete` returns the overdue tail and the gate is red.
