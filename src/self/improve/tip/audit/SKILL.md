# self/improve/tip/audit — what is blocking, scored

`scoreGap` is the whole ranking rule: **unblock / (cost × risk)**, floored to an integer so the order is stable. The highest wins; there is no tie-break by taste.

`auditSelfDevGaps` finds the gaps by measuring — the leftover sites, the wave attractions, the residual admin TTFB — never by asking an agent what it thinks is important.

`secretNamesPresent` reads the **names** of secrets in `.env` and never a value. A tip that depends on a credential can then be gated on the credential *existing* without the credential ever being read: the gate learns "the fuse password is set" and nothing more.

**Honest boundary.** A gap is a CANDIDATE, scored — never a verdict that the work is worth doing. The score ranks what the scan can see; a blockage nothing measures is invisible here, and that is the loop's standing gap rather than proof it has none.
