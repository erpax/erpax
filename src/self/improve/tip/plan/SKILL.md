# self/improve/tip/plan — one gap, one executable tip, or a refusal

The highest-scoring gap becomes a **trinity tip**: FORM is one executable sentence, CODE names the exact files or commands, PROOF names the exact green signal that would settle it.

`isPreciseTip` is the gate, and it fails closed. A tip matching `VAGUE_TIP_RE`, or carrying no concrete command, or naming no checkable proof, is **refused with its reason** rather than emitted. That refusal is the point: a loop that can emit *"continue improving"* will, and a tip nothing can contradict is a claim that reads as progress forever.

Forks dissolve — one tip per gap kind — so the loop cannot answer a single blockage three ways and call it three suggestions.

**Honest boundary.** This proves a tip is PRECISE, never that it is RIGHT. A perfectly concrete tip can point at the wrong work; precision is what makes that visible when the proof fails to go green.
