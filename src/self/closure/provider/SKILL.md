# self/closure/provider — importing the barrel IS the registration

Each provider file registers itself at its own bottom. Importing this barrel runs those
side-effects, so the set of available providers is the set of files present — there is no second
list to keep in step with the directory.

**Honest boundary.** Side-effect registration means import ORDER is load-bearing; a provider that
runs code at module top level is exposed to the same initialisation hazard any import cycle carries.

Composes: [[law]].
