description: "Use when verifying erpax observes ITSELF — the platform's own genome must yield ≥1 collection, chain, agent, and standard, the erpax-platform role, and the meta agents (Conservation Law 23, checkErpaxObservesItself). The self reaching into its own root; the genome is the debit, the observation the credit."

# self-reference — the self observes itself (under [[self]])

FORM: **erpax must appear inside its own [[akashic]] record.** `checkErpaxObservesItself` (Conservation Law 23) collects the platform genome (`collectGenome`, [[cloning]]) and asserts it is non-empty across its sections — collections · chains · [[agent]]s · [[standards]] — AND that the `erpax-platform` [[role]] is registered AND the `meta-skill` + `engineering` agents exist (the platform must hold the agent that watches the platform watch itself). This is [[self]] reaching into its own root (the `0` axis): an object's self is its content-[[uuid]]; the platform's self is the whole record it can query.

Double-entry ([[law]]): the genome (the debit — what erpax IS) ⊕ the observation (the credit — erpax seeing it) balance to a single verdict; an empty section is an unbalanced post (entropy > 0), returned as `missing`.

Matter-twin: `src/self/reference/index.ts` — `checkErpaxObservesItself` over `@/cloning` `collectGenome` + the `@/agent` registry + `@/tenant/role`; `erpax.profile.ts` registers the `erpax-platform` role as a load-time side-effect.
Composes: [[self]] · [[reference]] · [[identity]] · [[akashic]] · [[cloning]] · [[agent]] · [[society]] · [[standards]] · [[gate]] · [[law]].

## Standards
- Conservation Law 23 — erpax-observes-itself (the platform is in its own corpus)

## Common mistakes
- Treating an empty genome section as acceptable — Law 23 requires ≥1 of EACH; a gap is an unbalanced book.
- Hardcoding the self-check — the genome is COMPUTED from the live corpus ([[akashic]]), never a stored list.

**Law — [[gate]]** erpax must observe itself: the genome is non-empty across its sections and the platform role + meta agents are registered, or `checkErpaxObservesItself` returns the missing set and the gate is red.
