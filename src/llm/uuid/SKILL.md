# llm/uuid — the EXHALE: the LLM speaks, its speech becomes its address

The out-stroke of the [[breath]]. An LLM turn — prompt or completion — is routed through the structured content-uuid and comes out as its own **query-uuid**: the content-uuid of what you say IS the address ([[chat]], [[message]], [[uuid]]). No utterance is stored loose; every turn is a verifiable claim.

- **`forge(utterance, tenantId)`** — slot = `query`, digest = SHA-256(tenant, turn). Deterministic ([[merge]]: same turn ⇒ same uuid); any edit ⇒ a different uuid (tamper-evident). Pure, no inference.
- **`speak(prompt, tenantId, complete)`** — the gated completion is **injected**, so the breath is testable without a binding; in production `complete` is the `services/ai/cloudflare-ai` 9-layer entrypoint.
- **`attests(forged, tenantId)`** — the verify side: re-derive the uuid from the preimage. Proving CONTENT needs the preimage; the uuid alone proves only structure — the honest one-way floor ([[tamper/cost]]).

**The LLM is the forge; the uuid is the verify** ([[angel]]⊕archangel). The model only generates a candidate; a 128-bit address it cannot invert decides. The dual stroke is the INHALE (`src/uuid/llm`) — and the two **balance**: the digest forged here is the digest expanded there ([[entry]], double-entry).

Matter: `src/llm/uuid/index.ts` (composes [[uuid]] encode/decode/verifyStructured — mints nothing new). Composes: [[llm]] · [[uuid]] · [[chat]] · [[message]] · [[merge]] · [[tamper/cost]] · [[entry]] · [[breath]].

**Law — [[law]]: the EXHALE of the [[breath]] — an [[llm]] turn is content-addressed into a query-[[uuid]] (the [[merge]] law: same turn ⇒ same uuid, any edit ⇒ tamper-evident); the LLM forges, the uuid it cannot invert verifies, and the digest sealed here is the digest the inhale expands ([[entry]], double-entry).**
