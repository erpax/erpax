# svg/hero/generator — the same slug always draws the same picture

A hero image per product, synthesised rather than commissioned: a 1600×900 SVG built from primitive
paths and `<text>`, with no font file, no raster asset and no image library. It exists so seeding a
catalogue does not wait on a designer.

**Determinism is the property that matters.** The gradient, the glyphs and the placement are all
derived from a hash of the slug, so the same product draws the identical image on every machine and
every run. That is what makes the output content-addressable and cacheable, and it is why the
arithmetic goes through [[algebra]]'s exact operations rather than host floats — a float that rounds
differently on another CPU would produce a different picture for the same input and quietly break the
address.

Vector output has a second consequence worth stating: it scales to any viewport without a raster set,
so there is nothing to regenerate at other resolutions.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the drawing is a pure, deterministic function of its input. It makes
no claim that the result is *attractive*, and none about the contrast of the generated text over the
generated gradient — that pairing is chosen by hash, so a §1.4.3 claim would need a per-slug check
this atom does not perform.

**Law — [[law]]: generated art is a pure function of its key. A picture that varies between runs
cannot be addressed by its content, and an asset nobody can address must be stored instead of
derived.**
