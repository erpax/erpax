# user-roles

Join collection: users ↔ roles via [[users]] and [[roles]] relationship fields.

Enforces single-folder collection pattern: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners), co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks).

Access controlled via [[access]] (superadmin only: create/read/update/delete).

## Standards
- NIST INCITS-359-2012 role-based-access-control role-assignment
- ISO-27001 A.5.18 access-rights
- ISO-27002 §5.15 access-control
- ISO-27002 §5.4 segregation-of-duties
- ISO-19011:2018 audit-trail
- SOC-2 CC6.3 access-removal

**Law — [[law]]: a user-role is the join that grants a [[users|user]] the capabilities and skill routes of one linked [[roles|role]]; the assignment is deduplicated by hook ([[access]]).**
