# roles/registry — a role is what a person must satisfy, not a label on a user row

`ROLES_REGISTRY` binds each role to the standards it answers to and the chain steps it may
execute. `rolesIncompatibleWith` names the pairs one person may not hold at once, and
`validateUserRoleSet` refuses the combination — segregation of duties, enforced rather than
documented.

`ACCOUNTING_WRITE_ROLES` is the set that may move the ledger, which is the set an auditor asks
about first.

Composes: [[law]].
