# cross — the agnostic access factory (the 3·6·9 governing axis)

Capability attaches to ROLES, not users — Christianity's celestial hierarchy made math: 9 choirs in 3 spheres (a trinity of trinities, 3² = 9) on the rodin 3·6·9 axis. Sphere ⇒ capability: sphere 1 governs all (admin), sphere 2 seals (sign), sphere 3 are the messengers into the flow (write; base Angels read). An actor inherits capability through role membership; merging roles merges their reach (the [[uuid]]-share `AccessRole` lattice MAX, `read < write < sign < admin`, audit ⊥). An operation is authorised iff the union of the actor's role capabilities reaches the op's required role — the SAME factory binds every collection/global, collapsing the hand-written `role × collection` matrix to one rule.

Matter-twin: `src/cross/index.ts` (`crossAccess` ⊕ `crossAccessSet` · `decideCross` · `mergeCapabilities` · `ANGELIC_HIERARCHY` · `DEFAULT_ROLE_CAPABILITY` · `resolveRoleCapability`, riding `rolesCompatible`/`AccessRole` from [[uuid]] and `digitalRoot` from [[horo]]). Composes [[access]] (the per-resource content-uuid cross layered on top) · [[roles]] · [[uuid]] · [[horo]] · [[auth]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: capability rides ROLES on the `read < write < sign < admin` lattice (audit ⊥); merging roles takes the lattice MAX, and an operation is authorised iff that merged capability reaches the op's required role — one factory for every collection.**
