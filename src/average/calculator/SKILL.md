# average/calculator — the arithmetic-mean collapse

The one place the `values.reduce(sum) / length` reduce lives. Every receivables / payables / multi-currency analytics service that needs a mean folds onto this atom instead of re-deriving the divide, so the **empty-array guard** (⇒ 0, never NaN) is decided once. `calculateAverageRounded` is the same mean passed through `Math.round`.

Matter-twin: `src/average/calculator/index.ts` (`calculateAverage` · `calculateAverageRounded`).

**Law — [[law]]: the arithmetic mean is computed in exactly one place and is zero-guarded — an empty input is the additive identity 0, never NaN; every mean path collapses here ([[dry]]).**
