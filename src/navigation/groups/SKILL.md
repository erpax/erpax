# navigation/groups — a flat vocabulary of thousands is not browsable, so the trie gets hubs

`NAV_HUBS` names the one-word parents that root vocabulary nests under, and `navPathsForGrouping`
derives each atom's admin group from its path prefix. `isNavHub` decides membership.

Nav, `admin.group` and the sidebar all read the same prefix tree, so a folder move re-groups the
UI without anyone editing a menu.

Composes: [[path]] · [[law]].
