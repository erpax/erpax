# standards

The two directions of one boundary. `service` **gives** — it emits the canonical wire formats; `import` **takes** — banks and Peppol Access Points hand erpax an XML document and it routes to the canonical parser by a `format` discriminator, returning the typed structure the write path ingests.

They are siblings because they must agree on the same formats: a give that the take cannot parse is a boundary that only works outward.

Composes: [[standards]] · [[law]].
