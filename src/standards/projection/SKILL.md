# standards/projection — the catalogue, seen three ways

Three questions about one body of matter:

| projection | the question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaCoverage` | is every standard covered by a schema (family)? |
| `standardsUiWaves` | which admin surface is worth improving, biggest impact first? |
| `standardsIndex` · `lookupStandard` | where is standard `X`, in O(1)? |

They lived inline in the [[standards]] hub, which is a Payload collection — so a file that declares a table also held the derivations read off it. A hub holds no matter ([[rules]]/concentration); these are one child atom because they share one spine: **memoized on `catalogueRoot()`**, the content-address of the catalogue itself. Same catalogue ⇒ same root ⇒ the answer is reused, never re-folded.

That is the corpus's own economy applied to a read: the address is the memo key, so an unchanged catalogue costs a fold instead of a scan ([[gate]]/receipt says the same thing about the corpus).

**Honest boundary.** "Schema" here is the standard's FAMILY — its taxonomy — never a promise that a schema.org TYPE exists for each. Total coverage by SOME schema is the law; it is computed and refutable, and `uncovered` names every gap rather than rounding it away.

Composes: [[standards]] · [[merge]] · [[rules]].
