# NIST SP 800-108 — Recommendation for Key Derivation

**Edition in use:** NIST SP 800-108r1:2022 (HMAC counter-mode KDF).
**Publisher:** <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-108/rev-1/final>

## What's here

- `kdf.ts` — `deriveSecretFromPayloadSecret(purpose)` and the
  `internalSecretPurpose` enum (preview / cron / fieldEncryption).
  Implementation is HMAC-SHA256 over a versioned label
  (`erpax:derived:v1:<purpose>`), which conforms to RFC 5869 HKDF (extract +
  expand) for our short single-block output.

## Companion standards

- **NIST FIPS-198-1** — HMAC.
- **NIST FIPS-180-4** — SHA-256.
- **RFC 2104** — HMAC.
- **RFC 5869** — HKDF (HMAC-based key derivation).

## Used by

- `src/standards/nist-sp-800-38/aes-gcm.ts` — derives the field-encryption KEK.
- `src/payload.config.ts` — derives the cron-trigger bearer secret.
- `src/utilities/getPreviewSecret.ts` — derives the live-preview signing secret.
- All other internal authentication tokens that should not have their own env var.

Imports through the legacy `@/utilities/deriveSecret` path still work via the
deprecated shim.

## Out of scope

- Key rotation policy — `DERIVED_V1` prefix lets us bump the version when
  rotating without re-keying every consumer at once. New callers should pin
  their version.
- KMS / HSM-backed master secrets — application-layer code only here.
