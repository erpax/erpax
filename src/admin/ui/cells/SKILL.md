# admin/ui/cells — a list column renders the corpus's own coordinates, not a raw string

Four cells, each showing a value the corpus computes rather than stores: the content-uuid as a chip,
the horo digit, the path as an account code, the seal as a badge. A row in the admin panel is
therefore readable as an ADDRESS — where the atom sits, whether it is sealed — without opening it.

Rendering the raw uuid instead would put 36 characters in a column and say nothing.
