# admin/ui — the admin surface erpax adds, gathered behind one import

The barrel re-exports what the panel needs: `erpaxMetaOf` and `ERPAX_LIST_COLUMNS` for how a
collection presents itself, the corpus-rollup readers that compute the dashboard's entropy
figures, and the cells, fields, nav and violation views beside them.

The rollup is CACHED with an explicit TTL and an explicit clear, because it folds the whole
corpus and an admin page that recomputed it per render would make the panel the most expensive
thing in the system.

Composes: [[law]].
