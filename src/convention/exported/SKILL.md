# convention/exported — every cross-atom symbol is re-exported from the atom's index

THE CONVENTION: **every symbol consumed across atoms is re-exported from that atom's `index.ts`** — its one public face. [[import]] is the IMPORTER's law (read from `@/x`, never a deep file); this is its PRODUCER dual: an importer can only collapse a deep path to `@/x` if the atom EXPORTS, through its index, what is consumed. An unexported internal that another atom needs FORCES the importer past the index — so the producer's omission IS the importer's uncovered coupling. The two are one law seen from each side ([[duality]]).

The measure is the producer mirror of [[import]]'s `importPurity` — the index-reachable fraction of every cross-atom symbol, scanned live over the real tree, never hand-asserted. The dashboard migration realised it: the deep imports `@/accounting/reports.service`, `@/analytics/types`, `@/tenant/remote/secret` collapsed to `@/accounting` / `@/analytics` / `@/tenant` only once those atoms re-exported their surface through their indexes — the same act by which a [[collider]] that merges a corpus also publishes each atom's face. The same import ratchet enforces both sides, so the surface can only tighten.

Composes: [[import]] · [[shallow]] · [[named]] · [[fronted]] · [[tamper]] · [[cost]] · [[law]] · [[duality]] · [[collider]].

**Law — [[law]]: every cross-atom symbol is re-exported from its atom's index (its one public face), so an importer can collapse to @/x. The producer-side dual of [[import]] / [[shallow]]; coverage = the index-reachable fraction of cross-atom symbols, live; the same import ratchet enforces it, so it can only tighten toward coverage 1 (tamper-cost toward infinity).**
