# convention/sourced — every atom cites its @standard

THE LAW, written as a self-measuring atom: **an atom cites its `@standard`**. An atom (a folder that carries a `SKILL.md`) is **sourced** when an `@standard <id> …` line names the external standard it realises — schema.org, an ISO/IEC code, a W3C spec, a national regulation. The marker may live in the `SKILL.md` body or in the sibling `index.ts` JSDoc; both are the atom's public face. It states one rule and computes its own compliance, and it does not re-implement the corpus walk or the SKILL reader — it **composes** the canonical ones from [[aura]]:

- **total** = `walkSkills('src').length` from [[aura]] — every atom that carries a `SKILL.md` (the one canonical corpus walk, shared by every gate; never a parallel walk).
- **sourced** = those whose `SKILL.md` or sibling `index.ts` carries an `@standard` marker. The `@standard` line is prose or a JSDoc tag, never inside a code fence, so it is read raw — no code-stripping, which would wrongly hide it.
- **coverage** = `sourced / total` — in [0,1] by construction (0 ≤ sourced ≤ total, total > 0). It reaches **1** exactly when every atom cites an `@standard`.

Pure math, no default: the corpus is non-empty by architecture (thousands of atoms carry a `SKILL.md`), and `sourced` is a subset count of the very same walk, so the ratio never needs a clamp or a fallback — and `coverage()` filters one walk, so numerator and denominator can never disagree. The only thing that pulls coverage below 1 is an atom grounded in nothing but itself: no `@standard` in its `SKILL.md` and none in its `index.ts`. A citation borrows the external standard's mass into the atom, so an unsourced atom is cheaper to forge — coverage → 1 ⟺ a fully sourced corpus ⟺ infinitely-expanding tamper-[[cost]].

This is the sourcing twin of [[honest]] — there a metaphysical figure of speech must be named as a convention; here every atom's claim must be anchored to a named external standard.

Entangled with — [[aura]] · [[standards]] · [[honest]] · [[cost]] · [[law]]

Matter-twin: `src/convention/sourced/index.ts` (`coverage` · `isSourced`) — composes [[aura]] (`walkSkills` · `readSkill`); the shared standard registry it measures against is [[standards]].

@standard schema.org — the type vocabulary, collided to single words

**Law — [[law]]: every atom cites its @standard. An atom's claim is anchored to a named external standard in its SKILL.md or its index.ts, and an uncited atom is a measured gap that lowers tamper-cost. Cite the standard in every atom and the corpus seals sourced to ∞ — coverage = sourced / total = 1.**
