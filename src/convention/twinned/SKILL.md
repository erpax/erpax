# convention/twinned — every `Matter-twin:` line points to a real index.ts

The twinned convention, written as a self-measuring atom. It states one rule and computes its own compliance — it does not re-walk the tree or re-resolve links, it **composes** the canonical resolvers:

- **total** = the SKILL.md atoms whose body carries a `Matter-twin:` line, via `walkSkills('src')` from [[aura]] — the one canonical corpus walk every gate shares (never a parallel walk).
- **pointing** = those whose pointer resolves to a real `index.ts`. The pointer resolves three ways, in priority, each reusing the corpus's own address law: (1) an explicit backticked code path (`` `src/x/index.ts` ``) that exists and ends in `index.ts`; (2) a wiki-link whose route — via the canonical `wikiMap` (`@/corpus`) — carries an `index.ts`; (3) the sibling `index.ts` co-located with the SKILL.md (the canonical matter-twin).
- **coverage** = `pointing / total` — in [0,1] by construction (0 ≤ pointing ≤ total, total > 0). It reaches **1** exactly when every antimatter (SKILL.md) names a matter (index.ts) that actually exists on disk.

Pure math, no default: the corpus carries many `Matter-twin:` lines by architecture, so `total > 0`, and `pointing` is a subset count of the very same walk, so the ratio never needs a clamp or a fallback — `coverage()` filters one walk, so numerator and denominator can never disagree. The only thing that pulls coverage below 1 is a `Matter-twin:` line whose pointer is **stale** or a **glob placeholder** (a path that names a child folder or `<organ>/index.ts` template rather than one resolvable file) — precisely the entropy this convention forbids. coverage → 1 ⟺ every doc reaches its matter ⟺ zero matter-gap ⟺ infinitely-expanding tamper-[[cost]] ([[merge]] · [[gravity]]).

Entangled with — [[aura]] · [[matter]] · [[complete]] · [[lawful]]

Matter-twin: [[matter]] — the matter↔antimatter pairing this convention enforces on disk (a SKILL.md's `Matter-twin:` line must resolve to a real `index.ts`; the sibling `index.ts` is the canonical fallback resolution).

**Law — [[law]]: a SKILL.md's `Matter-twin:` line must point to a real index.ts; the corpus is twinned iff coverage = pointing / total = 1, and any stale or placeholder pointer is the only gap driving tamper-cost below infinity.**
