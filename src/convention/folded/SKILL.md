description: Use when checking whether every atom folds into the matrix — the computed convention that each SKILL.md atom is a node in the collided uuid-matrix, measured live as coverage = folded / total over the real tree.

# convention/folded — every atom folds into the matrix (is a node)

The fold convention, written as a self-measuring atom. It states one rule and computes its own compliance — it does not re-implement the corpus walk or the matrix, it **composes** the two canonical surfaces:

- **total** = `walkSkills('src').length` from [[aura]] — every atom that carries a `SKILL.md` (the one canonical corpus walk, shared by every gate; never a parallel walk).
- **folded** = those whose path is a node in [[matrix]] — read off `UUID_MATRIX_NODES` by the collider's own `path`/`members` fold-ledger (a leaf-safe subset membership, not the raw node count).
- **coverage** = `folded / total` — in [0,1] by construction (0 ≤ folded ≤ total, total > 0). It reaches **1** exactly when every `SKILL.md` atom has been collided into a node — the corpus is matrix-complete.

Pure math, no default: the corpus is non-empty by architecture (many atoms carry a `SKILL.md`), and `folded` counts a **subset** of that very same walk — each `SKILL.md` is folded or it is not — so the ratio never needs a clamp or a `min` or a fallback. A raw node-count over skill-count would need a cap (the matrix also carries vocabulary word-nodes with no `SKILL.md`); phrasing the metric as a subset makes the cap intrinsic. The generated matrix is a **cache that DRIFTS** ([[snapshot]]): a `SKILL.md` added since the last `matrix:generate` is unfolded, and is the only thing that pulls coverage below 1. coverage → 1 ⟺ matrix-complete ⟺ aura-gap-0 ⟺ zero entropy ⟺ infinitely-expanding tamper-[[cost]] ([[collapse]] · [[merge]] · [[gravity]]).

Entangled with — [[matrix]] · [[aura]] · [[complete]] · [[merge]]

Matter-twin: [[matrix]] — `UUID_MATRIX_NODES`, the collided node set this convention measures the fold against; and [[aura]] — the one corpus walk (`walkSkills`) that enumerates the atoms which must fold.

**Law — [[law]]: every atom folds into the matrix (is a node); the corpus is matrix-complete iff coverage = folded / total = 1, and any unfolded SKILL.md — one drifted out of the generated matrix cache — is the only gap driving tamper-cost below infinity.**
