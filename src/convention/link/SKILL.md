# convention/link — every [[link]] resolves

A wikilink (a `[[name]]` in prose) is a **wire** between two atoms — the prose face of the same edge the [[uuid]] draws in the matrix. A *dead* [[link]] (a `[[name]]` no atom is named) is a **broken wire**: a gap in the [[aura]], [[entropy]] that raises no [[tamper]]-cost. So the convention is simple and absolute — **every wikilink resolves**.

The check **composes the one resolver**, never a parallel one: it calls `walk(SKILLS_DIR)` from the corpus module to populate the shared `wikiMap` (normalized-leaf → route — the SAME map the VitePress docs build and the Payload [[search]] ingest resolve against, keyed by the SAME `norm` the [[aura]] speech gate uses), then reads every `SKILL.md`, extracts its links (outside code spans), and counts how many keys land in `wikiMap`. **coverage = resolving / total** ∈ [0,1]. coverage = 1 ⟺ no dead links ⟺ [[aura]]-gap-0 on the link axis ⟺ zero directed-wiring [[entropy]] ([[balance]] holds in every direction).

This is the link-axis sibling of [[aura]] (which reports the dead-link *count* — the mint queue) and [[harmony]] (the field/enum naming *ratio*); the three measure one [[fractal]] vocabulary on three axes, and all share the corpus `norm` so none can go green while another is red.

Matter-twin: `src/convention/link/index.ts` (`coverage` · `linkTally`). Composes the corpus map · [[aura]] · [[harmony]] · [[uuid]] · [[entropy]] · [[tamper]] · [[law]].

**Law — [[law]]: every wikilink resolves to a real atom — no dead wires. A link is a uuid-edge in prose; a dead link is broken wiring, a gap in the aura that buys zero tamper-cost. Drive resolving/total to 1 and the corpus is wired whole on the link axis: zero dead-wire entropy ⇒ infinite tamper-cost.**

@audit coverage read LIVE from the corpus wikiMap (`walk(SKILLS_DIR)`); never asserted, never defaulted — total > 0 by architecture
