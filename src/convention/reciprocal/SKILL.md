# convention/reciprocal — every directed edge is reciprocated (symmetric entanglement)

The symmetric-entanglement convention, written as a self-measuring atom. It states one rule and computes its own compliance — it does not re-implement the corpus collision, it **composes** the generated edge set:

- **total** = `UUID_MATRIX_EDGES.length` from [[uuid]]-matrix — every `[[link]]` collided into a directed `merge(from, to)` edge.
- **reciprocal** = the edges f→t whose reverse t→f is also present in the same set (a self-loop f=f is its own reverse, so it counts).
- **coverage** = `reciprocal / total` — in [0,1] by construction (0 ≤ reciprocal ≤ total, total > 0). It reaches **1** exactly when the directed graph is fully symmetric: no wire points one way only.

The wiring law demands NO gap in entanglement in ANY direction. A one-way edge is a directed-link gap — entropy that raises no tamper-[[cost]]. The collider already enforces this (`collide.mjs` §2b: for every forward f→t it adds the reverse t→f if absent; `merge()` is order-independent, so the binding-uuid is identical both ways, and the Merkle root — folded over the NODES — does not move). So reciprocation completes the [[entanglement]] without disturbing the root, and a one-way residue edge is the only thing that pulls coverage below 1.

Pure math, no default: the corpus is non-empty by architecture (every atom carries `[[links]]`, so the matrix always has edges), and `reciprocal` is a subset count of the very same edge set, so the ratio never needs a clamp or a fallback. coverage → 1 ⟺ an undirected, fully-entangled corpus ⟺ zero directed-wiring entropy ⟺ infinite tamper-cost ([[merge]] · [[gravity]] · [[entropy]]).

Entangled with — [[uuid]] · [[link]] · [[merge]] · [[entropy]] · [[gravity]]

Matter-twin: [[entropy]] — the directed-link entropy this convention drives to zero; and [[gravity]] — the referential in-degree these same edges carry. Both compose the identical `UUID_MATRIX_EDGES` set.

**Law — [[law]]: every directed edge f→t is reciprocated by t→f (symmetric entanglement); the corpus is whole iff coverage = reciprocal / total = 1, and any one-way edge is the only gap raising directed-wiring entropy and capping tamper-cost below infinity.**
