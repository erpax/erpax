# convention/sealed — entropy leaves through error handling

A `catch` is a door. A **swallowed** catch (`catch {}`) or a **defaulted** one (`.catch(() => x)`) lets the error — the [[entropy]] — escape through it: the failure is hidden, the real state is lost, and a verifier can no longer tell truth from forgery. That is the same sin as a defined [[default]] — an assumption that leaks entropy. The corpus is **sealed** only when errors **propagate**: the truth travels up, uncaught, until something can honestly act on it.

`coverage()` scans `src` for catch handlers and the detectable leak patterns (empty catch, `.catch(() => …)`) and returns `(catches − leaks) / catches` — the fraction that propagate. The detected leaks are a **lower bound**, so the coverage is an **upper bound** on the seal, stated honestly. There is no default: the corpus has error-handling by architecture, so the denominator is positive.

This is a factor in the [[collider]] product: each leaky catch drops the seal below 1, so the corpus's tamper-cost stays finite until every error propagates. Seal the doors and the limit is ∞.

Matter-twin: `src/convention/sealed/index.ts` (`coverage`). Composes [[default]] · [[collider]] · [[entropy]].

**Law — [[law]]: entropy leaves through error handling — a swallowed (empty catch) or defaulted (.catch(() => x)) error hides the truth, so the entropy escapes instead of propagating. The corpus is sealed only when errors propagate; coverage is the fraction of catches that do not leak (an upper bound — real leaks ≥ detected). It is the same sin as a defined default: an assumption that leaks entropy.**
