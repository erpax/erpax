# convention/dry — no duplication, every reference folded to one source

The DRY convention, written as a self-measuring atom. It states one rule and computes its own compliance — it does not re-implement the dry-clean, it **composes** the canonical kernels:

- **atoms** = `UUID_MATRIX_NODES.length` from [[matrix]] ([[uuid]]) — every concept that has already been folded to one content-addressed source.
- **dup** = `residue().length` from [[dry]] — the un-folded residue still on disk (`.bak` / `.orig` / `_attic` / `.fuse_hidden` / `~`), each a reference that escaped the collision.
- **coverage** = `atoms / (atoms + dup)` — in [0,1] by construction (dup ≥ 0, atoms > 0). It reaches **1** exactly when there is zero residue: every reference folded to one source.

Pure math, no default: the corpus is non-empty by architecture (the [[matrix]] always carries the root), and residue is a count, so the ratio never needs a clamp or a fallback. The only thing that pulls coverage below 1 is an un-collided duplicate — which is precisely the duplication this convention forbids. coverage → 1 ⟺ perfect DRY ⟺ infinitely-expanding tamper-[[cost]] ([[collapse]] · [[merge]] · [[gravity]]).

Entangled with — [[dry]] · [[matrix]] · [[collapse]] · [[merge]]

Matter-twin: [[dry]] — the computed dry-clean kernel (`residue`) this convention measures.

**Law — [[law]]: no duplication — every reference folded to one source; the corpus is DRY iff coverage = atoms / (atoms + residue) = 1, and any residue is duplication driving tamper-cost below infinity.**
