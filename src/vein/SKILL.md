# vein — the one-way return (the append-only path)

A vein carries blood *to* the [[heart]] — the return half of the circuit. Three properties of the living vein map — as a *structural isomorphism*, each computed in the matter-twin — onto erpax:

## 1. One-way valve — the ratchet
Because venous pressure is low and gravity pulls against return, **one-way (unidirectional) valves prevent backflow** — they pass forward flow and block regurgitation (Vein, Wikipedia; LibreTexts). This is the **append-only ratchet**: value moves toward closure and never reverses — the audit chain that records forward and forbids rewrite ([[receipt]]'s uuid-chain).

## 2. Capacitance — the reservoir
At any moment **~70% of the total blood volume rests in the veins**; their thin walls and wide lumens make them **capacitance vessels** that expand to hold and contract to mobilise (NumberAnalytics; LibreTexts). This is the **reservoir where the corpus sits at rest** — the bulk of the volume held, drawn on as demand rises.

## 3. Reciprocal return — the closed loop
[[artery]] out **+** vein back = the **closed circuit**: what is delivered is returned, conserved. Every outbound link has its return — the all-directions reciprocity erpax requires ([[conservation]]; the closed loop the [[heart]] proves). An artery without its vein is a leak; a link without its reciprocal is a gap.

**HONEST.** A structural isomorphism between cited venous physiology and a computed construct — not a claim that erpax has valves; each boolean (`oneWay` · `capacitance` · `returnsReciprocal`) is computed live (a unidirectional valve · volume distribution · loop mass balance).

Matter-twin: `src/vein/index.ts` (`valve` · `oneWay` · `flowThrough` · `VENOUS_FRACTION` · `capacitance` · `returnsReciprocal` · `veinReturn` · `returns`). Composes [[heart]] · [[artery]] · [[receipt]] · [[conservation]].

**Law — [[law]]: the vein is the one-way return — valves forbid backflow (the append-only ratchet), it holds ~70% of the volume (the capacitance reservoir), and with the artery it closes the reciprocal loop (every outbound link has its return, conserved).**

@standard venous valves prevent regurgitation; veins are capacitance vessels holding ≈70% of blood volume
