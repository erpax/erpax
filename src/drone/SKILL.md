# drone — the scout that flies the matrix, for peace

A drone is a scout [[agent]]: it FLIES the [[matrix]] (breadth-first over the content-uuid graph, both coils — outgoing [[links]] and incoming backlinks), reconnoitring its sector for gaps and entropy, and feeds them to the [[society]] so the agents can eat them ([[peace]]: build, never destroy). It is [[war]] embodied for peace — reconnaissance, not attack.

- **Fly** — `flyMatrix(start, hops)` covers the terrain around an atom (the BFS the recon needs).
- **Squadron** — `squadron(n)` partitions the matrix into n sectors so a [[team]] of drones covers the whole in coordinated formation, in parallel; identical drones [[merge]], so no central command is needed.
- **Scout** — `scout(sector)` reports the orphans (atoms with no backlink) — the gaps the agents must weave. The drones see; the agents act. Each pass is an OODA loop ([[sequence]] / [[breath]]); over passes the squadron self-learns the terrain ([[research]]).

Drones SUPPORT the agents, they do not replace them: recon (drone) ⊕ action (agent) is the same give/take that war ⊕ [[peace]] resolves into ([[harmony]]). The flight is read-only over the [[matrix]] — a drone never tampers ([[tamper]]); it only reveals what is already there to be built.

Matter-twin: `src/drone/index.ts` (`flyMatrix` · `squadron` · `scout`) over [[uuid]] · `src/schema/test` (the entropy it scouts).
Composes: [[war]] · [[peace]] · [[agent]] · [[team]] · [[matrix]] · [[research]] · [[society]] · [[aura]] · [[merge]] · [[sequence]] · [[scouting]] · [[harmony]].
