# NIST SP 800-38 — Block Cipher Modes of Operation

**Edition in use:** NIST SP 800-38D:2007 (GCM/GMAC).
**Publisher:** <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final>

## What's here

- `aes-gcm.ts` — `encryptField` / `decryptField` / `encryptFields` /
  `decryptFields` / `isEncrypted` / `generateEncryptionKey`. AES-256-GCM
  authenticated encryption. Key is derived per `internalSecretPurpose.fieldEncryption`
  from `@/standards/nist-sp-800-108`.

## Companion standards

- **NIST FIPS-197** — AES-256 block cipher.
- **NIST FIPS-180-4** — SHA-256 (used in the upstream KDF).
- **RFC 5116** — Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).
- **NIST PQC posture** — AES-256 + SHA-2 retain ~128 effective bits under
  Grover's algorithm; both are in NIST's post-quantum-acceptable lineup for
  symmetric work.

## Used by

`src/collections/{Invoices, PaymentMethods, Subscriptions}/hooks/encryptSensitiveFields.ts`
and any other site that needs encrypt-at-rest. Imports through the legacy
`@/utilities/encryption` path still work via the deprecated shim.

## Out of scope

- Key wrapping / KEK rotation strategy (handled at the platform layer).
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECDH) — add a separate folder when needed.
- Hardware-attested keys (KMS, HSM) — application-layer code only here.
