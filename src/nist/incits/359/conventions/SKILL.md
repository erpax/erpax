# nist/incits/359/conventions

Unix-style **rwx** vocabulary aligned with how Payload enforces access: every check still runs through collection `access` and the auth stack — this file only names operations and optional bit patterns so requirements ('tenant group rw-, world r--') map cleanly to product language.

Extracted from `nist/incits/359/conventions.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[nist/incits/359]].
