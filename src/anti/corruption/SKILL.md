# anti-corruption — corruption foreclosed by construction, not policed by policy

FORM: **a ledger is corruption-free iff four invariants hold at once, each a different impossibility.** erpax does not *trust* records and *audit* them after; it makes the fraud a contradiction that fails a pure check. Each invariant catches a concrete scheme, proven by test (`index.test.ts`, `cross-entity.test.ts`):

1. **content-uuid immutability** — the record's id IS the SHA of its content ([[identity]]); recompute ≠ stored ⇒ tamper detected, not believed. `detectTamper`.
2. **segregation of duties** — creator ≠ approver ≠ payer (four-eyes); no single actor completes a value transfer ([[access]], SOX §404). `detectSodViolation`.
3. **double-entry balance** — Σdebit = Σcredit; value cannot be fabricated from nothing ([[balance]], [[accounting]]). `detectImbalance`.
4. **no-delete / reversal-only** — history is append-only; correct by a reversing entry, never erase a posted row ([[reverse]], [[supto]] Наредба Н-18). `detectIllegalErasure`.

`scanTransaction` runs all four; any finding is a corruption signal. All pure (no I/O) ⇒ testable. A document `afterChange` [[hooks]] hook + a scheduled audit job consume it over the live ledger, each pass emitting an audit [[event]].

The costliest schemes are invisible to single-record checks — they live in the join across entities and across institutions (`cross-entity.ts`): self-dealing (approver is a beneficial owner of the payee), shell/ghost vendors, multiple-invoicing, bid-rotation rings, split purchases. The [[merge]] law itself is the multiple-invoicing detector: same content ⇒ same id, so one invoice claimed twice is a collision ([[holographic]]: the whole graph is recoverable, the [[fractal]] check runs at every scale — line, document, institution, federation).

The two sides are [[duality]]: the in-ledger invariants (matter) and the cross-entity graph checks (the schemes immutability cannot see). This skill is the answer-path holding SOX §404 / COSO-2013 / ISO-27001 A.8.15–8.16 / FATF R.24 / ACFE forms — see [[standard]] for version pins.

Sequence position: **9** (unity / verification / audit — the conservation check that closes a pass), on the ring 0·3·6·9·1·2·4·8·7·5 (see [[sequence]]).

**Law — [[law]]: a ledger is corruption-free iff four invariants hold at once — content-uuid immutability ([[identity]]), segregation of duties, double-entry [[balance]], and reversal-only history; fraud is a contradiction that fails a pure check, not a record to be trusted-then-audited.**

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (the 7-dim instrument reads SKILL.md; these atoms declare these standards in this section) -->
- `@standard ISO/IEC-27001:2022`
- `@standard ISO-19011`


- **ISO-19011:2018** — audit-trail integrity-verification. `scanTransaction` is the executable audit check.
- **SOX §404** — segregation-of-duties internal-controls. `detectSodViolation` enforces creator ≠ approver ≠ payer (four-eyes).
- **ISO-27001 A.8.15 logging A.8.16 monitoring (tamper detection)** — `detectTamper` implements the monitoring obligation.
