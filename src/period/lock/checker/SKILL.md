# period/lock/checker — a closed period refuses new postings, proven

`checkPeriod(postingDate, locks, isReversal, isPriorPeriodAdjustment)` decides posting eligibility against the fiscal calendar. The rule — **you cannot post to a closed period** — is the SOX §404 internal control an auditor personally signs. It was a bare `@invariant` ([[rules]]/refutable: asserted, nothing to contradict it); now it has a proof leg:

- **open** period → new postings allowed
- **locked / archived** period → new postings refused (`requiresAdminOverride`), **except** a reversal (`allowReversals`) or a prior-period-adjustment (`allowPriorPeriodAdjustments`) — the two exceptions the law names
- **unparseable date** → **fails closed**: an `Invalid Date` matches no period and would otherwise fall through to `allowNewPostings: true`, silently bypassing the lock — so it is denied and forced to admin override

That last leg is the auditor-facing bug this atom was hardened against ([[rules]]/audience — the §404 fail-open was invisible from every seat but the auditor's): a date the system cannot place in the calendar must never be freely postable.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the *decision* — locked ⇒ refuse, with the two exceptions — not that the lock STATUS is correct (that a period marked `open` truly should be) nor that the override, once granted, is justified. It closes the fail-open door; the human override remains a gated, logged act.

**Law — [[law]]: a closed period refuses a new posting — admin override required — allowing only a reversal or a prior-period-adjustment; and a date that cannot be placed in the calendar fails closed, never bypassing the lock.**

## Standards

- **SOX §404** — internal controls: you cannot post to a closed period.
