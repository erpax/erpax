# pipeline — the order is the law

A workflow correct today gets reordered tomorrow by someone fixing an unrelated step.
Each law here exists because the opposite ordering **shipped**.

## The race

`ci.yml` and `cloudflare.yml` both triggered on `push: main`, independently. Nothing
connected them, so they ran in parallel and **a commit whose tests were failing
deployed anyway**. CI going red afterwards changed nothing — the Worker was already
live.

Deploy now triggers on `workflow_run` of CI, refuses any conclusion but `success`, and
checks out `workflow_run.head_sha` — **the commit CI actually verified**, not whatever
`main` points at by then. Without that last part a push landing mid-run would deploy
code nothing tested.

## Migrate after build, never before

`Migrate remote D1` ran **before** the build. A build that failed therefore left the
**production schema migrated for a Worker that never shipped** — schema ahead of code,
and nothing to roll it back. Build first: a compile failure now costs nothing.

## Gates in front, smoke behind

The contract gate and boot gate are deterministic — they cannot flake on someone
else's uptime — so they belong **before** the deploy. The UI smoke tests the deployed
Worker, so it can only run **after**. A gate after the deploy protects nothing, and a
smoke before it tests nothing.

## The release

`publish-packages` must assert the tag matches the package version **before**
`npm publish`, or a mistyped tag ships a version nobody asked for under a name that
cannot be unpublished.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the STEPS ARE ORDERED, never that any step works — a
perfectly ordered pipeline of broken gates passes. It also reads only the two
workflows it names; a third that deploys by another route is invisible to it.

**Law — [[law]]: a deploy follows a green CI on the commit CI verified, builds before
it migrates, gates before it ships and smokes after. Order is not style here — every
inversion of it has a blast radius in production.**

Composes: [[deploy]] · [[outward]]/gate · [[run]]/load · [[law]].
