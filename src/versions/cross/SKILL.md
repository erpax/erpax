# versions/cross — one change mints ONE leaf, read three ways

Every entity change content-addresses to a leaf. That same leaf is simultaneously the VERSION (a
new content-uuid), a TAMPER-COST increment (one more link a forger must rewrite) and an ANALYTICS
point (a timestamped change event). `versionCross` produces it; `chainChecks` verifies the chain
it extends.

So versioning is not a per-collection flag switched on for the collections someone remembered. It
is a property every content-addressed entity already has, and this reads it.
