# rodin/state — the question that needs the matrix, and only it

`../index` is arithmetic on residues mod 9: `orbit`, `composeSteps`, `compositionMatrix`, `cayleyIsCyclic`. Pure, small, and what every caller of this atom actually wants.

`stateUuids` asks a different question — *which content-uuids carry each state* — and to answer it reads `UUID_MATRIX_NODES`: **4.2 MB, one node per atom in the corpus**. One import, one function, and every consumer of the arithmetic paid for it:

```
cloudflare/seal → nist/sp/800/108 → rodin → @/uuid/matrix → a node literal per atom in the corpus
```

A key-derivation function reached `orbit`, and got the whole corpus with it.

**The third time this shape appeared in one cut** — after `cloudflare/bindings → @/diamond` and `path → @/uuid/matrix`. A heavy import serving a minority of a file's functions, with every consumer of the majority paying: `@erpax/cloudflare` went **5,879 KB → 100 KB** once all three were separated.

**Honest boundary.** The arithmetic in `../index` is unchanged and still proven there; this only moves the one function whose answer lives in the matrix. Its own CLI no longer prints the populated-digit count, because that count is this atom's to report.

Composes: [[rodin]] · [[uuid]]/matrix · [[digit]].
