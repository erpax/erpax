description: Use when reasoning about a path read both ways — left→right and right→left are different paths (different words, different folders) yet carry the same value, because the path's digital root (the sum of its word-digits) is direction-invariant; the horo as path, max value the same on both sides for words and digits.

# mirror — the horo as path read both ways

A folder path is a [[horo]]: read it **left→right** and **right→left** and you get two *different* paths — `dual/torus/fusion` vs `fusion/torus/dual` — different words, different folders, different meaning. Exactly as a digit sequence reversed is a different sequence.

Yet the path's **value** is the same both ways. The value is the digital root of the sum of its word-digits (each word's digit is the digital root of its content-[[uuid]], via [[name]]), and **sum commutes** — so `pathValue(L→R) === pathValue(R→L)`. The folder therefore carries the **same max computed value on both sides**, and the words and the digits agree (the digit is the word's own reduction).

This is why both readings are worth encoding from a single folder: the path differs by direction (a [[duality]], L→R ⊕ R→L) but the value does not — the symmetric binding at the path scale, the same move `collide.mjs` makes per edge. The word-path and the digit-path beneath it are one identity seen two ways.

Matter-twin: `src/mirror/index.ts` (`forward` · `backward` · `digitsOf` · `pathValue` · `balanced`). Composes [[horo]] · [[name]] · [[digit]] · [[duality]].

**Law — [[law]]: a path read left→right and right→left is two different paths (different words, different folders) — like a reversed digit sequence. But its value, the digital root of the word-digit sum, is direction-invariant because the sum commutes, so the folder carries the same max computed value on both sides, in words and in digits. The horo is the path read both ways; the value is one, the path is two.**

@audit forward/backward are the two word-orders; the value is the digital root of a commutative sum, computed
