# field — the Payload translate hook

Payload uses this hook to become **self-translating**. It is an `afterRead` field hook: on read, it projects the stored source value into `req.locale` **through the shared messaging-uuid** ([[translation]] · `translateVia`), so a field renders in any language or dialect **without per-locale storage**. Write the source once; every locale is a computed projection.

- **Rosetta pivot at read-time** — the N²-pair translation matrix folds to N renderings + one pivot, evaluated by the hook. `bg` and `de` render from the same uuid with no bg↔de table.
- **Honest fallback** — where a locale's rendering is the unregistered **seed**, the hook returns the **source** unchanged. It never fabricates a translation. Non-string / empty / non-concept values pass through.

Matter-twin: `src/translate/field/index.ts` — `translateField(table)`, a `FieldHook` factory closed over a [[translation]] table (dependency-injected, so it stays pure and testable). Wired into the central [[hooks]] barrel for collections to use.

**Honest boundary.** The projection and the O(L)-not-O(L²) routing are computed; the per-language/dialect **content** (the renderings) is the seed — a dictionary or model registers it, surfaced as `seed:true` upstream, never invented. Arbitrary free text beyond the registered concept table is the model's job (the oracle bit), not this hook's.

**Law — [[law]]: the CMS self-translates by projecting through the shared uuid, not by storing pairs. Write the source once; render any locale via the rosetta pivot at read-time; fall back to the source where the rendering is still the seed, and never fabricate.**

## Standards

- **Payload field hooks** — `afterRead` field hook contract.
- **BCP-47** — language and dialect subtags as the locale keys.
