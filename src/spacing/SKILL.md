description: "Use when plant geometry sets density and yield — in-row × between-row spacing and rows-per-bed determine plants per area (plants/acre = rows ÷ in-row-spacing ÷ bed-center × 43,560), which sets seed/transplant counts and, with per-plant yield, total yield. Tighter is not linearly more: beyond an optimum, plants compete and per-plant size falls."

# spacing — plant geometry that sets density and yield

**spacing** is the planting geometry — **in-row** distance × **between-row** distance × **rows per bed** — that fixes **plant density** (plants per unit area) and through it the [[seed]]/[[transplant]] count and the [[yield]]. The arithmetic (UGA C1313): `plants per acre = rows-per-bed ÷ in-row-spacing(ft) ÷ bed-center-spacing(ft) × 43,560`. Density × per-plant yield = area yield — so spacing is the lever between [[crop]] geometry and [[yield]].

The trap is non-linearity: **tighter spacing does not scale yield linearly** — beyond an optimum, plants compete for light/water/nutrients, per-plant size and quality fall, and total yield plateaus then drops. Spacing also sets the [[cultivation]] room (can a wheel hoe pass?) and the bed footprint a demand plan consumes ([[bottleneck]]). It is a [[measure]] (length) feeding [[agriculture]]'s [[yield]] geometry.

**Law — [[law]]: planting geometry (in-row × between-row × rows-per-bed) fixes plant density and through it the [[seed]]/[[transplant]] count and the area [[yield]] (density × per-plant yield) — but tighter is not linearly more: beyond an optimum plants compete and per-plant size falls, so yield plateaus then drops.**
