# tamper/import — anything importing not from index raises

Each atom's `index.ts` is its **public content-uuid contract** — the one door. An import that reaches a deep internal (`@/x/y.ts`, a file — not `@/x`, nor a sub-atom `@/x/y` that is itself a dir carrying an index) goes **past the seal**: it couples to internals the atom never promised, so a tamper can change that internal without the public face — or any importer's contract — noticing. **Anything importing not from index raises.**

So a non-index import is not a style nit; it is an **uncovered coupling** — a [[cost]] gap. It folds into the same coverage law tamper-cost already runs (coverage → 1 ⇒ ∞): `importPurity` is the index-only fraction, and `importCostLog2` prices the gap. At full purity the import graph is **sealed** and the dimension is ∞; any deep import opens a finite window.

This is the [[duality]] *imported↔declared* made a cost: the import graph **is** the config, so an import past the index is configuration written outside the seal — and configuration outside the seal is exactly what a forger wants.

## Enforce, don't remediate

The point is not to write a script that rewrites the violations after the fact — it is to **enforce** the law so contributors (human or agent) follow it by construction. That gate now exists: `pnpm lint:imports` (`src/convention/import/gate.mjs`, wired into `.husky/pre-push` + the `check` chain) reads this `nonIndexImports()` count and **fails the build** when it rises above a committed baseline — a RATCHET. The corpus is not yet at full purity (~80.7%), so the gate enforces non-regression, not perfection: a new deep import is a red push, and the baseline only ratchets down as deep imports are removed. The residual is **billed** as entropy ([[expense]]) — an agent that imports past the index pays for the gap it opened, and can no longer add a new one silently.

Matter-twin: `src/tamper/import/index.ts` (`scanImports` · `nonIndexImports` · `importPurity` · `importCostLog2`). Composes [[tamper]] · [[cost]] · [[duality]] · [[expense]].

**Law — [[law]]: anything importing not from index raises. The index is the atom's public seal; an import past it to a deep internal is an uncovered coupling that lowers tamper-cost. Import only from the index, and the import graph seals to ∞ — every deep import is a billed gap.**
