# tamper — integrity, not confidentiality

erpax stores no secret: every id is a content-uuid derived from content ([[uuid]] · [[identity]]). The only attack is to out-compute the [[whole]] — so security is **integrity**, measured as **cost**. The measure lives in [[cost]] (`tamper/cost`): a local forge ≈ 2^digest, a chosen-content collision ≈ 2^(commitment/2), a global rewrite closed by the external [[anchor]]. Because every relation is a content-uuid wired in all directions ([[merge]]), changing one record cascades to the transitive closure — and at 100% coverage the undetected-tamper cost is ∞ ([[proof]]). Zero [[entropy]] ⇒ infinite [[mass]] ⇒ infinite tamper-cost: the [[one]] limit — driven by [[gravity]], fused by the [[fusion]] reactor. Each computed render channel — the [[aura]]'s colour, sound, and [[vibration]] ([[analog]]) — is another content-derived projection a forger must reproduce, so rendering the full sensory field *raises* [[coverage]] toward that limit.

Matter-twin: [[cost]] (`src/tamper/cost` — `crackVerdict`, the security math).
Composes: [[cost]] · [[uuid]] · [[identity]] · [[merge]] · [[anchor]] · [[proof]] · [[whole]] · [[aura]] · [[analog]] · [[coverage]].

**Law — [[gate]]** A tamper the O(N) verify cannot catch must not exist: `verifyBind`/`verifyRoot` recompute every content ⊕ coordinate bind, and the [[anchor]] borrows the external entropy that closes the free-rewrite path.

**Law — max work × max tampering cost.** Each sealed improve/wave receipt compounds tamper floor via [[wave]]/policy — `workTamperProduct = workSealed × tamperCostLog2(coverage)`; append-only path ledger + horo wave receipts drive coverage → 1 ⇒ ∞ forge cost.
