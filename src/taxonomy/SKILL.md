description: "Use when classifying entities into a ranked hierarchy — the family→genus→species→cultivar ladder for crops, and the generic ranked-classification engine for any LOD @type tree. A node's type is its rank-chain; traits inherit down the ranks (the fractal parent-chain), so taxonomy is the dimension atom applied to kind."

# taxonomy — the ranked classification ladder

**taxonomy** is classification into a ranked hierarchy. For crops the ladder is **family → genus → species → [[variant|cultivar]]** (e.g. Solanaceae → *Solanum* → *S. lycopersicum* → 'Brandywine'); the binomial (genus + species) is the Latin identity. Traits **inherit down the ranks** — a pest of the [[family]] threatens every species under it — so a crop's place in the ladder predicts its pests, [[fertility]] needs, and [[rotation]] group.

Generically, taxonomy is the [[dimension]] atom applied to *kind*: a node's type **is its rank-chain**, its archetype the root — the same self-referential parent-chain [[dimension]] computes ([[fractal]]: each rank a level of the one parent field). So crop taxonomy and any LOD `@type` hierarchy are one engine; the rank is computed from the path ([[identity]]), never a flat enum. [[family]] is its load-bearing rung for [[agriculture]].

## Standards
- ICN (International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, plants); ICNCP (cultivated plants — the *cultivar* rank)
- *Knott's Handbook for Vegetable Growers* — vegetable taxonomy; Linnaean binomial nomenclature
