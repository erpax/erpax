description: "Use when a living stock is valued by its total mass, not per-individual — standing biomass (kg) is the IAS-41 fair-value unit for an aquaculture stock, a forest stand, or a bee colony's strength: mass × forward price − costs-to-sell. Its growth rate is biological transformation. The non-individuated living-asset measure, shared across aquaculture/forestry/apiculture."

# biomass — the living mass of a stock; the fair-value unit of non-individuated life

**biomass** is the total live mass of a stock — the unit a living asset that is *not* counted head-by-head is measured and fair-valued by. It is the load-bearing [[measure]] across the non-livestock living-production domains: an [[aquaculture]] pen's standing fish weight, a [[forestry]] stand's standing-timber volume, a bee [[apiculture|colony]]'s strength. Its IAS-41 fair value is **biomass × forward price − costs-to-sell** ([[biological/assets]]); its growth ([[rate]]) is the **biological transformation** the standard splits from price change.

Biomass is to the [[aquaculture]]/[[forestry]] stock what the counted [[herd]] is to [[livestock]] — the aggregate the [[biological/assets|biological asset]] is carried at, drawn down by [[mortality]] and realized at [[harvest]] (felling, cropping) into [[items|inventory]]. Stocking density is its [[capacity]] ceiling; growth-and-yield models [[forecast]] it.

## Matter-twin

`src/biomass/index.ts` exports five pure functions:

- `standingStock(individuals, meanMass)` — total live mass of the stock (n × mean mass; the IAS-41 carrying unit)
- `fairValue(biomass, forwardPrice, costsToSell)` — IAS-41 balance-sheet value: mass × forward price − costs to sell
- `biologicalTransformation(massStart, massEnd)` — signed period mass change; positive = growth, negative = mortality drawdown
- `meanAnnualIncrement(volume, age)` — FAO forestry MAI = volume / age; returns 0 for age ≤ 0
- `stockingDensity(biomass, area)` — carrying-capacity density = biomass / area; returns 0 for area ≤ 0
