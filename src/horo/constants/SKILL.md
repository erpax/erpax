# horo/constants

## when

Use when referencing the horo ring's static definition — the seven positions, measure names, type guards, and mathematical constants that define the state ring's fixed structure.

## why

The horo ring (`[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 9]`) is the closed set of valid flow/lifecycle states in erpax. Every position has a meaning (base, share, weave, crest, descent, round, unity), and the set is finite and known. Constants and type definitions belong here, not scattered; this atom keeps them addressable and citable.

## usage

```typescript
import { HORO_DIGITS, isHoroStep, horoMeasureOf, type HoroStep } from '@/horo/constants'

if (isHoroStep(digit)) {
  const measure = horoMeasureOf(digit)
}
```
