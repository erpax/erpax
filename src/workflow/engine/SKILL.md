# workflow/engine — the state machine, read

A `WorkflowDefinitions.stateMachine` is **inert data until something reads it**. This is the
reader: `attemptTransition(sm, from, event)` decides whether the move is legal and returns the
next state with the content-uuid event to emit, and `outgoing` · `emittedEvents` ·
`crossDomainEdges` describe the machine's shape.

It also **audits itself**: `deadEnds` names states nothing leaves and `noInbound` names states
nothing reaches — the disconnected-organ gaps, found by the same code that runs the organism.

Pure: no I/O, so a collection's `beforeStatusChange` hook consumes `attemptTransition` and an
`afterChange` hook emits `result.emits`, while the tests need neither a DB nor a boot.
