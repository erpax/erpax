description: Use when authoring data-driven multi-step approval rules for any collection — BPMN-2.0 step kinds (approval, all-of-N, any-of-N, notification, service task, decision), assignee modes, SLA escalation, JSON-Logic conditions, and state-machine lifecycle gate without a code change. The reusable approval-template collection.

# workflow-definitions

Workflow Definitions — BPMN-style multi-step approval definitions.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

Composes [[collections]], [[fields]], [[hooks]], [[access]], [[standard]], [[proof]].

Workflow instances are gated by [[horo]] state machine transitions; audit evidence preserved via [[identity]] versioning.

**Law — [[law]]: a workflow-definition is the reusable, data-driven approval TEMPLATE — BPMN-2.0 step kinds, assignee modes, SLA escalation, and JSON-Logic conditions for any collection authored without a code change — inert form until [[workflow|a process]] runs it, its instances gated by [[horo]] state-machine transitions.**
