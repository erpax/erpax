# workflow/schema — the schema face of [[workflow]]

`index.ts` re-exports the parent barrel, so `@/workflow/schema` offers exactly what `@/workflow`
offers today. **The matter has not moved yet**: this atom is the namespace a hub split named for
the shape a workflow definition must take before an engine can read it, and its own `test.ts` pins the FACE so a caller importing through this path keeps
working while the extraction is finished.

Stated rather than dressed up: until the schema matter is lifted out of the parent, this is a
namespaced view, not a separate implementation ([[rules]]/concentration — matter belongs in the
child, and here it still sits in the hub).

Composes: [[workflow]].
