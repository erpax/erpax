# evidence/attestation — the cover sheet is what makes a capture into evidence

`buildEvidenceAttestation` produces a PDF declaring which run captured this evidence, when, and
against which tenant; `signEvidenceAttestation` applies a PAdES signature where a signer is
configured.

A screenshot with no provenance is a picture. An auditor accepts a capture when the claim about
its origin is attached to it and signed, which is exactly what ISO 19011 §6.4 asks of evidence.

**Honest boundary.** The attestation states the run's own account of itself; it proves the
declaration was signed, never that the capture was faithful.

Composes: [[law]].
