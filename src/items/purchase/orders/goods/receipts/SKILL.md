# goods-receipts

Goods Receipts — second leg of three-way match (PO → Receipt → Invoice).

Single-folder collection node with co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.ts` (schema + invariant checks).

## Architecture

GR receipt confirms goods arrival and triggers GL accrual posting. Revenue recognition timing is determined by shipment FOB point (IFRS-15 §38-42), not GR date. GR is goods-in-transit interim state; final revenue trigger is shipment FOB point via purchase-orders Incoterms.

GL posting (debit inventory, credit accounts-payable) on GR; revenue posting on shipment FOB date. IFRS-15 §31 requires substantiation that GR date ≠ revenue date.

**Law — [[law]]: a goods receipt is the second leg of the three-way match — it confirms vendor goods arrival and posts the GL accrual (debit inventory, credit AP), while revenue timing stays deferred to the shipment FOB point, so GR date ≠ revenue date.**
