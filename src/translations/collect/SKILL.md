# collect

The collector for [[translations]] (the [[translation]] model · the [[message]] messaging-uuid): walks every `SKILL.md`, ports its translatable strings (name, description) into a content-addressed table — one canonical catalogue (the mass) plus a massless per-folder `translations.ts` projection. Computed, `--verify`-gated, idempotent.

Flatten · DRY · keep the gravity — the compute lives here, the per-folder files are its shadows.

**Law — [[law]]: the collector walks every SKILL.md and ports its translatable strings into the one content-addressed [[catalogue]] — computed, idempotent, --verify-gated; the per-folder files are its shadows ([[merge]]).**

@audit ported from the live tree, never hand-maintained
