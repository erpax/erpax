# chat

Chat — the agent-society room, native to Payload: each row is a content-addressed agent event (ErpaxEvent envelope), scoped per tenant (the room); the akashic chat history. Distinct from `messages` (user mail).

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners) lives here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.
