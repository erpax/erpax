# skill/router/build/void — 265 bytes should not cost six seconds

The full skill index walks every `SKILL.md` and produces ~80MB, which no Cloudflare Worker can hold (3MB script limit). CI and deploy write an **empty pool** instead, so the static import resolves and nothing is baked in.

That stub is 265 fixed bytes. Emitting it cost **6.3s on a CI runner, in every job** — not because writing is slow, but because the emitter it lived in imports [[aura]], [[navigation]] and the skill upgrade seal at module top level. ESM evaluates those whether the stub path needs them or not, and it needs none of them.

| | |
| --- | ---: |
| `corpus skill-stub` via the full emitter | 2.9s local · **6.3s CI** |
| the same 265 bytes from here | **0.53s** |

**The shape is spelled once.** `skillIndexSource` is the only place the generated file's format exists, and the full emitter writes through it — an extraction that left the format in two places would trade six seconds for a drift nobody would notice until a Worker refused the bundle.

The name is the corpus's own word. `stub` is not in the shared vocabulary — nearest is `sub`, edit distance 1 — and the vocabulary axis is a DOWN-ONLY ratchet at zero, so an ungrounded atom name reddens it. What this writes IS the void: an index with no members.

**Honest boundary.** This makes the STUB cheap; the full emit is unchanged and still belongs to local skill-router research, where its cost is paid once and knowingly. The banner still names `build/index.ts` because that is the emitter a reader should go to — the generated header is a pointer, not an attribution.

Composes: [[skill]]/router · [[cloudflare]]/capacity.
