# upgrade

Computational frontmatter for the skill corpus: derived from `deriveFolderModel`, `diamondUuid`, `coordinateAddress`, typography partitions, and the diamond pipeline stage chain (`path` → `trinity` → `boundary` → `links` → `horo` → `seal` → `uuid`) — never hand-pinned. Each stage carries a `stageUuid`; the fold is `computationUuid`. Materialize with `pnpm skill:upgrade`; gate with `pnpm skill:upgrade:check`.

**Law — [[law]]: sign every document at every stage in frontmatter — `signatures.stages[]` must match recomputed `computeDiamond` seals; drift fails closed.**
