# skill

The gate that keeps every `SKILL.md` machine-readable.

`frontmatter` scans all SKILL.md files and refuses three things: an unquoted
`": "` in a description (which breaks js-yaml), a `name:` that disagrees with its
folder, and a new hyphenated atom folder. The grandfather set is now **empty** — the
six vocabulary atoms it once held were nested, so the rule admits no exceptions.

**The barrel is deliberately narrow.** It exposes `frontmatter` only. `skill/router`
carries a ~77MB generated index, so a barrel that re-exported it would drag the whole
corpus into every importer — reach the router by its own path. A face that costs
77MB to touch is not a face.

Composes: [[law]].
