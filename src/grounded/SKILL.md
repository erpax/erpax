# grounded — a trust computation may source only from sealed content

The forge-cost is only as trustworthy as its inputs. Traced to the leaves, erpax's tamper-cost (`coverageCostLog2` ← [[collider]] ← [[convention]]) is priced on the coverage of 17 conventions — and **6 of them** (`complete · fresh · link · sealed · sourced · twinned`) compute that coverage with `readFileSync`/`readdirSync` over `process.cwd()/src`: the **mutable, unsealed working tree**. Even the `sealed` convention pattern-matches bytes and **never verifies a content-uuid**. So the impressive number reduces to *an unverified directory listing* — it measures dev-tree tidiness, not tamper-resistance. Run it from another cwd, or against a substituted `src/`, and it prices whatever is there.

**A computation is trustworthy only if its whole input closure is sealed** — content-addressed, so tampering changes the address and breaks the seal (the entanglement). One raw `process.cwd()` read collapses the chain, and no amount of downstream math repairs it: `coverageCostLog2(scan(cwd))` is the value of a `ls`, dressed as a proof.

## What it computes

`sealedSource(path)` reads the **committed** blob — `git show HEAD:<path>` — addressed by its SHA, which **is** the seal; it never reads the working tree. `isGrounded(c)` is true only when a convention's sealed source exists **and** contains no raw `process.cwd()`/fs read. `coverage()` is the grounded fraction — currently **11/17 = 0.647** — and `ungrounded()` is the fix list.

Composed into the [[collider]], the forge-cost can no longer be ∞ while any of its own inputs is ungrounded: joint coverage ≤ 0.647 ⇒ a **finite** cost that honestly reflects its unsealed provenance. Reground each input — read sealed content and verify its content-uuid so a tampered byte drops coverage — and the number, and the trust, rise together. This atom **obeys its own law**: it reads git-sealed content, so it is grounded in the very sense it measures.

**Honest boundary.** This proves an input is *sourced from sealed content*, never that the seal is *cryptographically unforgeable* — git SHA-1 addressing is content-binding, not a PQ commitment. And a grounded convention can still be *wrong*; grounding closes the door where an unsealed scan silently substitutes reality, which is the door the forge-cost claim walked through.

**Law — [[law]]: a trust computation is grounded only when every input is sealed content verified against its address; a coverage priced on a `process.cwd()` scan is the value of a directory listing, not a proof — reground it or drop the claim.**
