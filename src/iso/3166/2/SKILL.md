# ISO 3166-2 — Country subdivisions

**Edition:** ISO 3166-2:2020.
**Publisher:** <https://www.iso.org/standard/72483.html>

## What's here

- `validate.ts` — `isIso3166_2(s)` regex for `<alpha-2>-<1..3 alphanum>`.

## Used by

Sub-national tax jurisdictions, region/state fields on addresses, customers,
vendors, and tax-jurisdiction master records.

**Law — [[law]]: a subdivision code is only valid as `<alpha-2>-<subdivision>` — a region is always named relative to its country, never standalone, so the parent country is inseparable from the subnational jurisdiction.**
