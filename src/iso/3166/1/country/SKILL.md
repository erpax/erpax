# iso/3166/1/country — a country is a bundle of decisions, fetched by its code

`COUNTRY_BUNDLES` holds a canonical bundle per country and `getCountryBundle` returns the one for
an alpha-2 code: its holidays, its VAT treatment, its bank-statement and invoice formats, its
signing profile.

Scattering those across the code that needs them is how one module ends up believing a different
VAT rate than another. Bundling them per country makes the country the unit a reviewer checks.
