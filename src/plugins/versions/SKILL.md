# plugins/versions — versioning is enabled at the chokepoint, never per collection

`versionsPlugin` turns on Payload's native `versions` for every collection except those named in
`VERSIONS_EXCLUDE`, with `DEFAULT_MAX_PER_DOC` bounding the history.

Per-collection opt-in means the collection added next Tuesday is unversioned and nobody notices
until its history is wanted. A chokepoint makes the exception explicit and countable.

Composes: [[law]].
