# plugins/taggable — anything is taggable, because the tag points at a content-uuid

`taggablePlugin` makes every record taggable without adding a relationship per collection: the
tag references the record's **content-uuid**, so one edge type reaches everything.

It is the same move that makes anything accountable. A per-collection join table would need one
new table per collection, and the corpus would grow a table every time it grew a noun.
