# plugins/naming — a database identifier is derived from its path, never invented

`uuidNamesPlugin` names every internal table and column by content-addressing the path it sits
at. Nothing is chosen, so nothing drifts: the same path always yields the same identifier, and
two atoms cannot quietly share one.

A multi-word invented name is a sentence pretending to be an identifier — it carries a claim
about meaning that nothing checks. A derived one carries only its address.

Composes: [[uuid]] · [[path]] · [[law]].
