description: Use when collapsing MCP api-key capability columns to a compact deny-list — the matrix→cross collapse for @payloadcms/plugin-mcp at erpax scale (D1 100-col cap); virtual afterRead repopulates the handler's read shape default-open, narrowed by scopes.deny.

# scopes — MCP api-key capability collapse

At erpax scale (~206 collections) the plugin's per-collection×operation boolean columns exceed D1's 100-column cap. **scopes** strips the stored capability matrix, keeps one compact `scopes` JSON field (optional deny-list), and repopulates the exact doc shape `getMcpHandler.js` reads in `afterRead` — default-open, narrowed per key. Byte-identical enforcement; the matrix became a cross (sibling: `@/access/cross`).

Matter-twin: `src/plugins/mcp/scopes/index.ts` — `toCamelCase` · `capabilitiesFor` · `collapseApiKeyScopes`. Wired in `payload.config.ts` on the api-keys collection.

**Law — [[law]]: scopes is one word on the plugins/mcp diamond path — `plugins/mcp/scopes`, not camelCase `mcpScopes`.**
