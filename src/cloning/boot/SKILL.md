# cloning/boot

bootFromFederation — ingest a published genome into a clone instance.

Extracted from `cloning/boot.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[cloning]].
