# artery — the Windkessel (the elastic buffer)

An artery carries blood *away* from the [[heart]] — and the large arteries do more than conduct: their elastic walls **buffer** the heart's pulses into steady flow. Three properties of the living artery map — as a *structural isomorphism*, each computed in the matter-twin — onto erpax's [[cache]] / buffer:

## 1. Windkessel — pulsatile in, steady out
The **Windkessel effect**: during systole the elastic aortic wall *expands to store* part of the stroke volume; during diastole it *recoils to release* it, converting the heart's **pulsatile output into a more continuous flow** and damping pressure swings (Windkessel model, Frank; ScienceDirect). Computed, the reservoir lowers the waveform's peak-to-trough — exactly a **buffer that turns bursty writes into steady throughput**.

## 2. Elastic recoil — perfusion between beats
Because the recoil releases stored volume *during diastole*, peripheral **outflow stays > 0 even when inflow is zero** (between beats). The downstream is never starved — the buffer maintains delivery across the gaps in the pulsatile source, the way a [[cache]] serves reads between writes.

## 3. Conserves — the mass balance
Across the cycle, **Σ inflow = Σ outflow + what the reservoir still holds**: nothing is created or lost, only delayed. The double-entry of carried value ([[conservation]]) — the same closed-loop balance the [[heart]] proves and the [[vein]] returns.

**HONEST.** A structural isomorphism between the cited Windkessel model and a computed construct — not a claim that erpax has an aorta; each boolean (`smoothsPulsatile` · `elasticRecoil` · `conservesFlow`) is computed live (a two-element Windkessel: compliant reservoir + peripheral resistance).

Matter-twin: `src/artery/index.ts` (`windkessel` · `pulsatility` · `pulsatileSource` · `smoothsPulsatile` · `elasticRecoil` · `conservesFlow` · `arteryWindkessel` · `isWindkessel`). Composes [[heart]] · [[vein]] · [[cache]] · [[conservation]].

**Law — [[law]]: the artery is the outbound Windkessel — its elastic reservoir smooths pulsatile ejection into steady peripheral flow (the buffer), recoils to perfuse between beats (never starving the downstream), and conserves (Σ in = Σ out + held); direction is its essence — a vessel that reverses is no longer an artery.**
