# leases/lease/period/postings/hooks/posting

Lease Period Posting Hook — fires on `LeasePeriodPostings.status → 'posted'` and books the canonical IAS 16 / ASC 842 period entry.

Extracted from `leases/lease/period/postings/hooks/posting.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[leases/lease/period/postings]].
