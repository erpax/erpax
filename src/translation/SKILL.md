# translation

The MODEL of the [[translations]] collection — strict singular-model / plural-collection.

A **translation** is one translatable message ported from a `SKILL.md` into code: "whatever the SKILL.md says, computationally ported". It is content-addressed by its **messaging-uuid** (the fold of its word-atom uuids — [[message]]) and split into its **words** (every word is an atom — [[word]]); its `values` hold the per-locale forms ([[localize]] · the supported locales), `en` the source.

Per-folder `translations.ts` files are **massless projections** — pure data, `import type` only. The gravity (the compute) lives here (`index.ts`: the `Translation` type + `defineTranslation`) and in [[translations]] (the collector). Flatten · DRY · keep the gravity ([[merge]] · [[collapse]]).

Attested in schema.org — translationOfWork · workTranslation

**Law — [[law]]: translation is one schema.org word, content-addressed; the same word collides every schema.org term that contains it into one atom, deduped, never duplicated.**
