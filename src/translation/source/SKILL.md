description: "Use when the translation intelligence must be trained with REAL renderings, not fabricated ones — fetches a word's community-maintained labels in every language from Wikidata (CC0), the zero-cost self-training source. Returns the concept id + description so the sense is verified before registering; returns null when no concept exists. Same pattern as the live sanctions check: a real authoritative endpoint, actually fetched, never invented."

# source — real translations from Wikidata

The training source for the translation intelligence. Renderings are **fetched from free authoritative community data**, never fabricated — the same discipline as the live [[sanctions]] check: a real endpoint, actually called.

Verified live (2026‑07‑15): `heart → Q1072 → сърце / Herz / cœur / 心臓 / сердце / قلب / καρδιά` in **286 languages**, all CC0.

- **`fetchLabels(word)`** — resolves a word to its Wikidata concept (the top search match) and returns that concept's labels in every language, plus the `qid` and `description`.
- **`toValues(labels, locales)`** — filters to the locales you register; uncovered locales stay honest seed‑gaps.

Matter‑twin: `src/translation/source/index.ts`. The `fetch` is injectable, so tests are deterministic; the endpoint itself is verified reachable live.

**Honest boundary.** The top search match is a **candidate sense** — "heart" resolved to the organ; a different intended meaning needs disambiguation, so the `qid` + `description` are returned to **verify before registering**. A wrong‑sense label is worse than a seed‑gap. Not every corpus word has a Wikidata item (returns `null` → the human/model supplies it). **CC0** — attribute to Wikidata. Registering these labels moves [[translation]]'s `trainingCoverage` toward 1 with real data, honestly.

**Law — [[law]]: train the translation intelligence from authoritative free data, verified by sense, never fabricated. A fetched label with a matching concept is real; a guessed one is entropy. Where no concept exists, the gap stands until a human or model fills it.**

## Standards

- **Wikidata** — the multilingual knowledge base (CC0); labels per concept.
- **Wikimedia MediaWiki API** — `wbsearchentities` + `wbgetentities`.
- **BCP‑47** — language and dialect tags.
