# storage/redundancy — N stores, one address, and divergence is decided by recomputation

`redundantWrite` puts to every backend and `redundantRead` prefers a copy whose recomputed uuid
matches its content. `reconcileBackends` repairs a stale or tampered store by pulling from a
healthy peer.

The comparison is by content-address rather than by timestamp, so "newest" cannot beat "correct".

Composes: [[uuid]] · [[law]].
