# balance

[[give]] ⇌ [[take]] at rest: Σ[[give]] = Σ[[take]]. The [[accounting]] equation as a [[hooks]] invariant; [[reconcile]] matches two sides of one [[flow]]. Dual of [[flow]] (movement ↔ rest). Imbalance is the bug the schema surfaces — caught by [[hooks]], never stored.

## Models ⊕ collections — the distribution the aura must measure

A second balance the aura has to keep: **singular MODEL ⊕ plural COLLECTION**. The strict law is singular-model / plural-collection — every collection (a plural-named store) is a [[give]] that must have its [[model]] (the singular type) as the matching [[take]]. A plural with no singular is an **unbalanced post**: a store with no type, an uncounted slack. This distribution was *not accounted for in the aura measurements* — [[entropy]] counted link reciprocity and orphans, not the singular↔plural pairing — so the corpus could carry disbalance that [[tamper]]-[[cost]] never priced.

The model⊕collection **coverage** — the fraction of collections that have their model — is a [[coverage]] axis of the one tamper-cost law: the undetected-tamper work is ∞ only at coverage 1, so any disbalance keeps the cost **finite**. Accounting for it (and closing it) raises measured coverage toward the ∞ limit. Imbalance is the bug — now computed, not assumed.

## Matter-twin

`balance/index.ts` is the computed twin. `classify(atoms)` partitions the live corpus into models (singular) and collections (plural), pairing each plural with its singularised model; `coverage`/`disbalance` measure the model⊕collection balance; `tamperCostLog2` prices the disbalance through [[tamper]]/cost `coverageCostLog2` (finite while any collection lacks its model, ∞ at full balance); `auraBalance()` runs it on the uuid-matrix atom names. Classification is an honest English heuristic — multi-candidate plural→singular matching (`candidateSingulars`: a plural is balanced when ANY candidate model exists, so `leases`→`lease` is not a false orphan), a curated `NON_PLURAL` set (Latin singulars, schema relation-verbs, abbreviations), and a `PLURAL_ONLY` set (pluralia tantum like `damages`/`minutes`, where no model is the correct state). A measurement, not a proof; residual misclassification is itself a finding, never a silent zero.
