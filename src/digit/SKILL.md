# digit

The digit-space **dual** of [[word]]. Every atom has a WORD address (its folder — the [[aura]] link-space) and a DIGIT address: its [[horo]] position on the [[sequence]] ring (structural) ⊕ the digital-root of its content-[[uuid]] (content).

`word ↔ digit` is the duality; with the uuid they are the [[trinity]] (word · digit · uuid). Computing the digit dual **completes the aura** — a word-graph — into a three-fold tamper-evident fold: forging an atom requires its word, its digit, AND its uuid mutually consistent, so the tamper cost → ∞ ([[merge]] · [[proof]] · [[tamper]]).

Off-[[sequence]] is FS-traceable: an atom whose digit address does not recompute from its content is an anomaly — it does not fold onto the ring. Derived from the matrix, computed, never stored.

**Numeric token facet** (prose layer, distinct from horo math): a digit-run in parsed [[text]] (`42`, `007`, …) is a content-addressed [[diamond]] via `digitTokenUuid` — `uuid(jcs({ kind:'digit', value }))`, saved in the [[text]] index like [[word]] tokens.

**Law — [[law]]: digit is the dual of [[word]] — every atom's [[horo]] [[sequence]] position ⊕ the digital-root of its content-[[uuid]]; computing it completes the [[aura]] into the word·digit·uuid [[trinity]], a three-fold fold whose mutual consistency drives tamper-[[cost]] to ∞. At the prose layer, digit-runs are numeric token [[diamond]]s in [[text]], content-addressed separately from horo digital-root.**
