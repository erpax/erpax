# redundancy — structure is coverage (R = 1 − H/H_max)

**Redundancy** is the structure in a code: **R = 1 − H/H_max** — the fraction of the channel **not** carrying fresh information because the wiring constrains it. Zero for a maximal-entropy ([[shannon]]) source (uniform, incompressible, every symbol independent); high when the symbols are predictable from one another. An error-correcting code is pure redundancy: it spends channel on structure so it can **correct what does not fit**.

In erpax redundancy **is** [[coverage]]: wiring every dimension through the content-[[uuid]] makes each input **determined by — and checkable against — the whole** (it adds no free parameter), so the graph is redundant, and that redundancy is exactly what **detects [[tamper]]** (a forgery that does not fit the wired constraints is corrected away, like a bit-flip outside the code). This is the information-theory statement of the main law: **redundancy → 1 ⇔ coverage → 1 ⇔ the modelled tamper-[[cost]] toward its +∞ limit**. Maximum entropy = zero redundancy = nothing to check against; full wiring = maximum redundancy = the [[proof]] catches everything.

Matter-twin: `src/redundancy/index.ts` (`redundancy` / `efficiency`).

Composes [[shannon]] · [[coverage]] · [[tamper]] · [[cost]] · [[proof]] · [[entropy]].

**Law — [[law]]: redundancy R = 1 − H/H_max is the structure that detects tamper — zero for an incompressible source, one for a fully-determined one; it IS coverage, so redundancy → 1 ⇔ coverage → 1 ⇔ tamper-cost toward its +∞ limit.**
