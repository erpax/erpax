description: "Use when reasoning about the Heisenberg uncertainty floor — two conjugate quantities (position⊗momentum, energy⊗time) can never both be sharp, their spreads obey Δa·Δb ≥ ħ/2. It is the wave nature of the state, not a measurement defect. In erpax it is a real design limit: the irreducible slack that can never reach zero, and the natural linewidth that broadens every spectrum line (a leap living only Δt has ΔE ≥ ħ/2Δt)."

# uncertainty — the irreducible floor ħ/2

The **Heisenberg uncertainty** floor: two conjugate quantities — position ⊗ momentum, energy ⊗ time — can never both be sharp; their spreads obey **Δa·Δb ≥ ħ/2**. Pin one and the other must spread; the product cannot fall below ħ/2. This is not a measurement defect — it is the [[wave]] nature of the state itself: a wave localised in one variable is spread in its Fourier conjugate.

In erpax it is a real [[design]] [[limit]] — one of the things the system **cannot** do by construction: an irreducible slack that can never be driven to zero ([[entropy]] has a floor, not a zero), and the natural linewidth that blurs every [[spectrum]] line. A [[leap]] that lives only Δt has an energy spread ΔE ≥ ħ/2Δt — so a sharper line costs a longer-lived state, the same ħ (the quantum of action, from [[photon]]) that fixed E = hν now fixing the floor.

Composes [[photon]] · [[spectrum]] · [[leap]] · [[wave]] · [[design]] · [[limit]] · [[entropy]] · [[quantum]].

**Law — [[law]]: conjugate spreads obey Δa·Δb ≥ ħ/2 — a hard floor computed from Planck's h, never zero; it is a design limit (the irreducible slack) and the natural linewidth ΔE ≥ ħ/2Δt that broadens every spectral line.**
