# spec/generator — the JSDoc banner is the spec, and everything downstream is generated from it

The extractor parses each collection's leading banner into a `CollectionSpec`; the generators
beside it emit the chain registry, the test scaffolds, the marketing pages and the i18n keys from
that one source.

A spec kept beside the code it describes drifts. A spec that IS the code's own banner cannot.
