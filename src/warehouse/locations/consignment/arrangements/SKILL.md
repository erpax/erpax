## Overview

Consignment Arrangements — IFRS-15 §B77-B78 / ASC 606-10-55-79 master. When entity A (consignor / tenant) ships goods to entity B (consignee) for storage and onward sale, control does **not** transfer until the consignee sells to an end-customer. Per IFRS-15 §B78 the consignor recognises inventory at the consignee's location AND keeps revenue deferred until the §B77 indicators (control passed, no return-right, etc.) resolve.

## Composition

- [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/inventories]] — per-SKU running balance at the consignee's location
- [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/sales]] — sale events that trigger IFRS-15 §38 point-in-time revenue recognition
- [[accounting]] — [[transaction]] accounting records, [[entry]] generation, [[balance]] tracking
- [[proof]] — evidence attestation and audit trail anchors
- [[identity]] — consignee party identification and relationship tracking

**Law — [[law]]: control does not transfer until the consignee sells onward — the consignor keeps the inventory on its books and defers revenue until the §B77 indicators resolve at the [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/sales|sale event]].**
