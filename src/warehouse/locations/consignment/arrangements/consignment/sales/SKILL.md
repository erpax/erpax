# consignment-sales

Consignment Sales — sale-by-consignee events that resolve the [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements|arrangement]]'s IFRS-15 §B77 control-transfer indicators.

Each row is one reportable sale the consignee made to an end-customer. `saleDate` IS the IFRS-15 §B78 control-transfer moment — the point revenue recognises (dual of [[close|deferral]] while goods sit unsold). On that event the afterChange hook derecognises [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/inventories|consignment inventory]] (a decrement of `quantityOnHand` + an `inventory-movement` of kind `sale_from_consignee`) and emits `consignment:sold`, which books one balanced [[entry]] on the [[accounting]] equation:

    Dr Cash / AR              netAmount
    Dr Commission Expense     commissionAmount
    Dr COGS                   cogsAmount (IAS-2 §34, = quantitySold × inventory.unitCost)
    Cr Revenue                grossAmount
    Cr Inventory at Consignee carryingCost

`commissionRatePercent` is snapshotted at sale time — a rate-card change is not retroactive. The [[horo|status ring]] runs reported → validated → posted → reversed (reversal-only, no destructive edit). The booked [[journal/entries|journal entry]] and the consignor's [[Invoices|invoice]] against the consignee close the loop.

**Law — [[law]]: the sale date IS the control-transfer moment — it derecognises consignment inventory and books one balanced [[entry]] (Dr Cash/AR + Commission + COGS = Cr Revenue + Inventory), reversal-only, never a destructive edit ([[balance]]).**
