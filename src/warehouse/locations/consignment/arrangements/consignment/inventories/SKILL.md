# consignment-inventory

Per-SKU on-hand running balance at consignee location per [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements|arrangement]]. The asset side of the IFRS-15 §B77-B78 ledger, paired with [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/sales|sale-by-consignee events]] and [[items/inventory/movements|underlying movements]].

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners), co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here. One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

The consignor (tenant) keeps the rows on its **own** balance sheet under IAS-2 §6 (inventory held at another location); the consignee never recognises them. Slice ZZZZ (2026-05-10): every shipment to / sale from / return from a consignee mutates this row's `quantityOnHand` + `valueOnHand`.

## Composition

- [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements]] — master agreement per arrangement
- [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/sales]] — sale events that decrement on-hand
- [[items/inventory/movements]] — underlying double-entry stock movements
- [[accounting]] — GL posting and entry generation
- [[transaction]] — transactional semantics
- [[identity]] — consignee party identification
- [[proof]] — audit trail evidence
- [[standard]] — regulatory compliance framework

**Law — [[law]]: the per-SKU running balance at a consignee location that stays on the consignor's own balance sheet — every shipment in, [[warehouse/locations/consignment/arrangements/consignment/sales|sale]] out, and return mutates quantityOnHand + valueOnHand ([[balance]]).**
