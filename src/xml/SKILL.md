# xml — one escaper, one element set, three serializers

Peppol UBL, ISO-20022 pain.00x and OECD SAF-T all emit XML. What they share is not a document
model — each owns its namespaces, element order and schema — it is the two layers underneath:

- [[xml]]/escape — the five predefined entities. Already shared; its own docstring says *"one
  definition, not three"*.
- [[xml]]/element — `escapeAttrs` · `leaf` · `wrap`, built on the escaper. **Not** shared until
  [[rules]]/copy body-hashed the tree and found five of those bodies byte-identical across the
  three exporters.

That gap is the pattern worth naming: the leaf of a shared thing gets shared, and the layer
built directly on top of it gets copied, because each caller writes it while thinking about its
own document rather than about XML.

**Honest boundary.** This atom is the primitives and nothing above them. It does not validate a
document against a schema, does not order elements, and proves no standard's conformance — each
exporter carries its own claim.

**Law — [[law]]: what every serializer needs is one atom, not one per serializer.**

## Standards

- **XML 1.0 §2.4** — predefined entities.
- **XML 1.0 §3.1** — start-tag, attribute, element content.

Composes: [[xml]]/escape · [[xml]]/element · [[rules]]/copy · [[law]].
