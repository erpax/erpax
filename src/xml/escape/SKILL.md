# xml/escape — the five predefined entities, once

`& < > " '` must be replaced before any text or attribute value is embedded in generated XML
(**XML 1.0 §2.4**). Get it wrong and a customer name containing `&` produces a document that is
not well-formed — an invoice a Peppol access point rejects, or a SAF-T file the tax authority
cannot parse.

One escaper serves every serializer in the corpus — Peppol UBL, ISO-20022 pain.00x, OECD SAF-T.
That was already true when [[rules]]/copy hashed the tree; what was **not** shared was the layer
built directly on top of it, which is [[xml]]/element's finding.

`escapeXml` returns `''` for `undefined` and `null` rather than the strings `"undefined"` /
`"null"`, so an absent field renders as an empty value instead of a word that looks like data.

**Honest boundary.** This escapes the five predefined entities and nothing else: it does not
handle CDATA, does not strip characters XML forbids outright (control bytes below U+0020), and
does not encode. A value carrying a raw control byte still produces a document a strict parser
rejects — [[rules]]/domain names that class for source files; the document surface is not gated.

**Law — [[law]]: escaping is a property of the format, not of the caller. One definition, or the
next serializer writes a sixth one and gets one of the five entities wrong.**
