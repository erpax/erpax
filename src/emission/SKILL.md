description: "Use when quantifying the greenhouse-gas mass a cycle releases — converting each gas to CO₂-equivalent via its Global Warming Potential, summing a multi-gas inventory, computing activity-based emissions (GHG Protocol), or measuring carbon intensity (CO₂e per unit output). The DEBIT/EXPORT side of [[sustainability]]."

# emission — the greenhouse-gas DEBIT a cycle releases (CO₂-equivalent)

**Emission** is the measurable export the sustainability cycle must keep within its sink capacity — the greenhouse-gas mass a process, boundary, or organisation releases into the atmosphere, expressed as a single **CO₂-equivalent (CO₂e)** figure by multiplying each gas's mass by its **100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP)** from IPCC AR5 (2014). CO₂ is the numéraire (GWP = 1 by definition); CH₄ carries a GWP of 28 (28× more warming per kilogram over 100 years than CO₂); N₂O carries 265. An unknown gas contributes 0 CO₂e — not silently inflated — so callers must audit their gas keys.

This is the **DEBIT** side of double-entry carbon accounting: every unit of emission debits the atmosphere's carrying capacity and must be matched by a credit (sequestration, avoided emission, [[conservation]] across a boundary) for the books to close. The compost exhale enters here — the carbon that soil respiration releases is an emission event, recorded and summed before the net-sink comparison is made. Carbon intensity — total CO₂e divided by a unit of economic or physical output — is the derived signal [[sustainability]] watches over time.

## The math (matter-twin)

`index.ts` exports:

- `GWP` — frozen `Record<string, number>` of IPCC AR5 100-yr potentials; mandatory anchors: `co2=1`, `ch4=28`, `n2o=265`.
- `co2e(gas, mass)` — mass × `GWP[gas]` (unknown gas → 0).
- `totalCo2e(emissions)` — Σ `co2e(gas, mass)` over an inventory array.
- `emissionFromActivity(activity, factor)` — activity × emission factor (GHG Protocol Corporate Standard).
- `carbonIntensity(total, output)` — total CO₂e per unit output; `output ≤ 0` → 0.

All functions are pure, edge-safe, and perform no I/O.

## Standards

- **IPCC AR5 (2014)** — Fifth Assessment Report, Table 8.A.1; 100-year GWP values used verbatim.
- **GHG Protocol Corporate Standard** (World Resources Institute / WBCSD) — Scope 1 / 2 / 3 activity-based emission method; `emissionFromActivity` implements the core formula.
- **ISO 14064** — International standard for greenhouse-gas quantification, monitoring, reporting, and verification at organisation and project level.
