# providers/header/theme — the header's theme is the page's, until a hero overrides it

The site theme is one value (`providers/theme`). The header's is a second, because the header
floats over whatever the page puts beneath it: a full-bleed hero paints a dark field and white text,
the header sits on top, and a header still in the light theme puts white links on white.

So `heros/high/impact` darkens the header on mount. This context is the channel it uses.

The initial value is **read from the DOM**, not defaulted — `document.documentElement` already
carries `data-theme` by the time React hydrates, because the blocking script in
`providers/theme/init/theme` set it before first paint. Defaulting to light here would flash the
wrong header on every load of a dark page. And it is guarded by `canUseDOM`, because this same module
is evaluated during server rendering where `document` does not exist — an unguarded read is not a
wrong value, it is a crash.

**Honest boundary.** This atom is the channel and its default. Whether any given hero sets the right
theme belongs to that hero, and the contrast of the result is a per-design question no provider can
answer.

**Law — [[law]]: state that already exists in the DOM is read from it, never re-defaulted. The
server-rendered attribute is the truth at hydration, and a component that re-guesses it flashes the
wrong answer on every load.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.2 §1.4.3** — contrast minimum, which is what a wrong header theme breaks.

Composes: `providers/theme` · `heros/high/impact` · `can/use/dom` · [[law]].
