# providers/theme/theme/selector — three options, because "auto" is one of them

The control that lets a person choose light, dark, or **auto**. Auto is not a synonym for the current
system value: choosing it *clears* the stored preference, so the page follows the operating system
from then on, including when the OS switches at sunset.

That is why the handler special-cases it. `setTheme(null)` is the documented way to say "no
preference" (`providers/theme`), and mapping auto to `setTheme('light')` would look identical the
moment it was clicked and then silently stop tracking the system.

Its own `value` state exists because the three options are not the same set as the two themes: `auto`
must remain selected in the UI after the underlying theme resolves to light or dark, or the control
would appear to jump to a different answer than the one the user picked.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the mapping from each option to the provider call, and that auto is
distinct. It does not verify what the OS then reports — that is `prefers-color-scheme`, and
`providers/theme` owns the reading of it.

**Law — [[law]]: a control offering "automatic" must clear the preference, not copy the current
value. A copy looks correct at the instant it is chosen and stops following the system forever
after.**

## Standards

- **WCAG 2.2 §1.4.3 · §4.1.2** — contrast; name, role, value of the control.
- **CSS Media Queries Level 5** — `prefers-color-scheme`.

Composes: `providers/theme` · [[ui]] · [[law]].
