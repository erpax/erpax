# business/chain — canonical business-chain barrel

The single import surface for ERPax business chains: every canonical workflow is a sequence of `(collection, action, emits, requires)` steps encoded ONCE in the registry and traced to a published standard. The Socratic check (canDo · makesSense · wired · isStandard) rides on each entry; `wireChainProducersFor` auto-injects the matching emit hooks so 80+ orphan emits collapse to one source of truth. Pure re-export — the matter lives in the sibling files.

Matter-twin: `src/business/chain/index.ts` (barrel) re-exporting `BUSINESS_CHAINS` · `BUSINESS_CHAIN_IDS` · `chainsForCollection` · `chainsForFeature` · `runChain` · `createChainContext` · `teardownChainContext` · `wireChainProducersFor`; types `BusinessChain` · `ChainStep` · `SocraticCheck` · `ChainRunResult`. A [[business]] workflow over the [[audit]]-evidenced corpus.

**Law — [[law]]: each business chain is encoded ONCE — its steps, standards, and Socratic check live in one registry entry, so a step's `requires` precede it and its producer wiring is the single source of truth for which events fire.**
