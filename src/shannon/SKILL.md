# shannon — information entropy (bits per symbol)

**Shannon entropy**: **H = −Σ pᵢ·log₂(pᵢ) bits** — the expected [[surprisal]] of a distribution (H = Σ pᵢ·I(pᵢ)), the average bits per symbol, and the irreducible limit of lossless compression (the source-coding theorem). It is **zero** when one outcome is certain and **maximal (log₂ n)** when all n outcomes are equally likely — the uniform distribution, the same maximum as [[boltzmann]]'s Gibbs entropy.

It is the information twin of thermodynamic [[entropy]] — literally the same −Σ p ln p form with a different constant (k vs 1/ln2). That is why erpax measures tamper-[[cost]] in **bits**: H is the information the content-[[uuid]] commits to, the bits a [[tamper]] must reproduce to forge undetected, the capacity of the channel a message rides. Low entropy (predictable) ⇒ high [[redundancy]] ⇒ strong tamper-detection; maximum entropy ⇒ incompressible, no structure to check against.

Composes [[surprisal]] · [[entropy]] · [[boltzmann]] · [[redundancy]] · [[cost]] · [[tamper]] · [[uuid]].

**Law — [[law]]: information entropy H = −Σ pᵢ·log₂ pᵢ is the expected surprisal — zero at certainty, maximal (log₂ n) at uniform — the bits a message carries and the bits a tamper must reproduce; it is the information twin of thermodynamic entropy (same −Σp ln p).**
