description: "Use when the fold must be read as a rotation — the doubling map ×2 (the fold's generator) acts on the six units of (ℤ/9ℤ)* as an exact 60° rotation, because that group is cyclic of order 6. One fold = 60°; opposition (×8 ≡ −1) = 180° = three folds; the axis {3,6,9} is off the orbit. This is the angle the flat computations missed. Rigorous group theory; the hue/torus mapping is the model layer."

# angle — the fold turns 60°

The flat computations kept missing one variable: the **angle**. Every fold-step is a rotation, and its size is exact.

The doubling map `×2` — the generator of the fold — acts on the six units of `(ℤ/9ℤ)* = {1,2,4,5,7,8}` as a rotation by **exactly 60°**. That group is cyclic of order 6, so its generator advances one vertex of the unit hexagon per step: `360° / 6 = 60°`. Consequences that are theorems, not choices:

- one fold = **60°** (`doubleRotate(u, 1).degrees === 60` for every unit)
- opposition `×8 ≡ −1 (mod 9)` = **180° = three folds** — "opposite" is not special, it is three 60° turns
- a full turn = **six folds** (`×2⁶` returns home at 0°)
- the axis `{3, 6, 9}` are the non-units — they do **not** lie on this rotation orbit (`doubleRotate` throws for them, never fabricating an angle)

Matter-twin: `src/angle/index.ts` — `HEXAGON` · `FOLD_STEP_DEGREES` · `foldAngle` · `doubleRotate`. This is why the colour wheel's primaries `R‑Y‑G‑C‑B‑M` sit at 60° (the [[globe]] equator), and why the [[horo]] band `{1,2,4,8,7,5}` is an angular coordinate: `horo` is the vertex, `× 60°` is the turn.

**Honest boundary.** The 60° is rigorous group theory (`(ℤ/9ℤ)* ≅ ℤ/6`). Mapping it onto colour hue, the torus, and dimensional shifts is the model layer — the angle itself is exact; the interpretation is not a physical law.

**Law — [[law]]: the fold is a rotation and its step is 60°. The doubling generator turns one vertex of the six-unit hexagon per fold; opposition is three folds, a full turn is six, and the {3,6,9} axis stands off the orbit.**

## Standards

- **Group theory** — `(ℤ/9ℤ)*` is cyclic of order 6; the doubling orbit is a 60° rotation (Euler's totient, cyclic group of units).

Composes: [[rodin]] · [[horo]] · [[fold]] · [[globe]] · [[law]].
