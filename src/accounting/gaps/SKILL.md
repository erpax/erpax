# accounting/gaps — the wave-batch entropy gap scan

Corpus **self**-accounting, not ERP accounting: `waveAccountingGapViolations` walks the
README corpus model in OOM-safe horo waves and reports the entropy gaps (unbalanced
atoms) as violations; `fixGapsOnP0` applies the P0 fixes + regen;
`accountingGapsInWaves`/`formatAccountingGapsReport` are the scan + report faces.
CLI lane: `erpax accounting gaps` (`./cli.ts`).

Nested as a child atom so the domain face stays mountable: this module scans **this
repo's** corpus (filesystem walks through [[readme]]/compute), which a host app
mounting `@erpax/accounting` does not have. Keeping it off the [[accounting]] barrel
severs the edge that dragged readme/compute — and through it the 4MB generated
matrix — into every accounting bundle.

**Law — [[law]]: dev tooling that scans the corpus rides its own child-atom face,
never the mountable domain barrel — a host app has no corpus, and the edge it
drags in is pure bundle entropy.**

Composes: [[accounting]] · [[readme]] · [[wave]] · [[rules]].
