# error/uuid — an error is a record, not an exception that escaped

`computeErrorUuid` content-addresses a failure and `toErrorInfo` gives it a typed shape, so the
same failure raised twice has the same address and can be counted, grouped and traced.
`wrapError` carries a cause without losing it.

An out-of-band exception is a fact the system had and did not keep. Addressing it makes the
failure participate in the same fold as everything else.
