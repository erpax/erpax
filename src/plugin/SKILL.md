# plugin — the model of one [[plugins]] row

A self-contained module that extends the platform. The singular model whose plural store is the [[plugins]] collection ([[balance]]: every collection has its model).

Composes [[plugins]] · [[platform]] · [[balance]].

## Deployment face — every [[diamond]] can plug into a host
Alongside the platform row model, **plugin** is one of three deployment faces every sealed [[diamond]] projects ([[diamond]] · [[worker]] · [[pwa]]). The **plugin face** extends a host that already runs: [[payload]] plugin (dimensional registry, multi-tenant middleware), Cursor [[hooks]], [[vitepress]] plugin, MCP server extension. Example: the dimensional [[plugin]] registry + multi-tenant [[payload]] config. `deploymentFaces` in `@/diamond` marks when this face materialises for a given `DiamondModel`.

**Law — [[law]]: plugin is the singular model whose plural store is the [[plugins]] collection — every collection [[balance]]s against its one model.**

**Law — [[law]]: the plugin deployment face is the host-extension of a [[diamond]] — Payload plugin, Cursor hook, VitePress plugin, or MCP extension that plugs into a runtime already running.**
