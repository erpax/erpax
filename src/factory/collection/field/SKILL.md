# factory/collection/field — the asks a collection should never make

Three builders, one law between them: **if the system can derive it, the user confirms rather than types** ([[rules]]/ask). User input is the highest cost in an ERP — paid on every document, forever, in attention and in error.

| builder | what it removes |
| --- | --- |
| `createCalculatedField` | a number the user would type. It is `admin.disabled` and carries its own `_calculator`, so the hook that writes it reads the function off the field instead of re-deriving it elsewhere |
| `createGLAccountFields` | a typed account code. Each is a **relation to `gl-accounts`**, required — so the account must exist before it can be named |
| `createLineItemArray` | an empty document. `minRows: 1` — a line-item table with no lines is not a document anyone meant to write |

**Honest boundary.** These remove the ask; they do not decide the value. `_calculator` is *carried*, not invoked here — a collection still wires the hook that runs it, and a field built by this atom with no such hook computes nothing.

Composes: [[factory]] · [[rules]]/ask.
