# factory/collection/base — the collection every accounting table is

117 of 118 collections once inlined the same 25-line preamble. That is not verbosity, it is a **shape problem**: a programmatic refactor over 118 hand-copied preambles lands in 118 different shapes, which is exactly how one collection ended up with an import spliced into another import.

So the plumbing became declarative. A collection declares `emits`, `horoStates`, its access role, and the factory wires the rest: tenant + createdBy auto-population, the audit-trail hook, the tamper-proof content-uuid field ([[integrity]]), the horo ring validator ([[horo]]), the chain producers, and the computed diamond attached at config-build.

**content-uuid enforces IDENTITY; horo enforces flow HARMONY.** A collection declaring `horoStates` gets its flow field validated at BUILD time — off-ring, out-of-order or duplicated states throw before the app boots, rather than accepting a bad transition at runtime.

**Honest boundary.** The factory proves a collection is wired CONSISTENTLY, never that its fields model the domain correctly — the shape is judged by [[factory]]/collection/shape, and what the table MEANS is a human's call ([[rules]]/collapse).

Composes: [[factory]] · [[integrity]] · [[horo]] · [[auth]] · [[diamond]].
