# factory/collection — one factory, four concerns, no hub matter

A 720-line file held four things at once: the collection builder, the lifecycle fold, the small field builders, and the rosetta that judges a collection's shape. Each was a child atom already; the scroll was the only thing holding them together.

| child | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| [[factory]]/collection/base | `createAccountingCollection` — the collection every accounting table is |
| [[factory]]/collection/lifecycle | the spine fold: events derived from a `status` select |
| [[factory]]/collection/field | the small builders — calculated value, GL relation, line items |
| [[factory]]/collection/shape | the rosetta — a signature, its ratchet, the corpus audit |

The hub re-exports and holds nothing ([[rules]]/concentration). That matters more here than anywhere: this factory is what every collection imports, and it is what collapsed the boot once when an import loop made its initialisation order an accident ([[rules]]/cycle). A barrel with no matter has no top-level work to run at the wrong time.

`EMITS_WIRED_KEY` lives in `base`, where it is written, and `lifecycle` reads it — the reverse would make the two children import each other.

Composes: [[factory]] · [[rules]]/concentration · [[rules]]/cycle.
