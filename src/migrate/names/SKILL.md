description: Use when collapsing each atom's test file to the canonical test.ts — the migrating skill that renames a single <Name>.test.ts to test.ts and flags multi-test folders for sub-atom collision.

# names

The canonical-name migrating skill ([[migrate]] · [[quaternary]]): collide each atom's test file to the law's `test.ts` slot.

A folder with one `<Name>.test.ts` / `index.test.ts` is renamed to `test.ts` — computable, idempotent, content unchanged (imports are unaffected; the vitest glob already matches `test.ts`). A folder with **multiple** test files (or a `.tsx` test) is flagged, never silently dropped: each tested unit must [[collapse]] into its own sub-atom.

Zero manual work — `--apply` runs the deterministic plan; [[quaternary]]'s test verifies the queue shrank. [[test]] · [[merge]].
