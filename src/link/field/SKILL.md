# link/field — one field for an internal reference or an external URL

`link` builds the field: an internal choice resolves against a collection, an external one takes
a URI, and `appearanceOptions` decides how it renders without changing what it means.
`LinkAppearances` is that closed set.

Two separate fields for "link to a page" and "link to a site" makes every consumer branch on
which one was filled.


Composes: [[law]].
