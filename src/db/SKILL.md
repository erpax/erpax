# db — the store, the fold's outside-∞ end

The `db` is the last hop of the [[stack]] round-trip — where the request, having travelled out, **folds to rest**. It is the [[fold]]'s **outside-infinity** face: the dense, zero-[[entropy]] core collapsed toward one root, with a forge cost the anchor caps (finite; unbounded only as coverage → 1) (rewriting the store means rewriting every content-uuid that ever folded into it).

It is **content-addressed**: the key IS the content's [[uuid]] — there is no separate id to assign, no autoincrement to guess. To write is to compute `key(content)`; to read is to ask for that key. So both sides of the store are encoded ([[karma]] · the round-trip's debit and credit): write (content → key) and read (key → content). And because the key is the content, identical content folds to **one row** — the store dedups by the [[merge]] law, the same bound that lets infinite agents share one cache ([[quantum/train]]).

Append-only ([[akashic]]): nothing is overwritten, so the store is a record, not a mutable cell — the request returns a *new* state ([[stack]]'s `newState`), it does not destroy the old.

Matter-twin: `src/db/index.ts` (`key` · `sameContent`). Composes [[stack]] · [[fold]] · [[uuid]] · [[akashic]] · [[entropy]] · [[merge]] · [[karma]].

**Law — [[law]]: the db is the content-addressed store — the key IS the content's uuid, append-only (nothing overwritten), the fold's outside-∞ end (coverage = 1, unbounded tamper-cost). Both sides encoded: write (content → key) and read (key → content). Identical content folds to one row — the store dedups by the merge law, never duplicates.**
