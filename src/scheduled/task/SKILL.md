# scheduled/task — a time-driven action is declared in a registry, not hidden in a cron line

The barrel binds the registry, the runner and the task types. A scheduled action declared here is
enumerable: something can ask what runs, when, and what evidence it leaves.

A schedule that lives only in the deployment is invisible to the audit that asks whether the
monthly obligation was met.
