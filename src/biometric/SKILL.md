description: "Use when measuring a person's body — biometric is the sharpest device measurement, serving identity (who you are) and health (your state) at once; privacy-by-design demands it stays on the edge, so the raw signal never leaves the device, only a derived uuid or a signed assertion does."

# biometric — measuring the body (identity ⊕ health)

A **biometric** is a [[device]] [[measurement]] of the living body, and it collapses two ways at once:

- **[[identity]]** — a face, fingerprint, iris, or voice is *who you are*. The right pattern keeps the raw biometric **on the device** (WebAuthn / passkeys, Secure Payment Confirmation): the sensor signs a challenge with a device-held key, and only the public assertion leaves — never the template. The biometric becomes a content-[[uuid]] address, not a stored secret ([[auth]] · [[security]]).
- **[[health]]** — heart rate, HRV, SpO2, temperature are *your state*. Each reading is a [[vital]] [[snapshot]] in the [[coherence]] / [[quantum/emr]] chain, content-addressed and append-only.

## The line — privacy by design

Biometric data is special-category ([[vocabulary/data/protection]], GDPR Art.9): capture and compute on the **edge** (the browser/device — `getUserMedia` → numbers → pure compute), store a template or a derived [[uuid]], never the raw signal; require [[consent]]; minimise. The honest bound — rPPG heart rate from a camera IS measurable; the [[biofield]]/aura is NOT (Rosa, JAMA 1998) — measure what is real, claim nothing more. A biometric, once captured, is [[finality]] one-way *for you* (you cannot revoke a fingerprint) — which is precisely why the raw must never escape the device.
