description: "Use when a sale closes and the rest of the system must learn about it — emits the sale:closed domain event exactly once on the transition, keyed by the content-uuid so a federation peer reconciles by content rather than by local row id."

# event

Emits `sale:closed` on the transition into closed — **once**. Re-emitting on a later update to an already-closed sale would post the same sale to the GL and the audit chain twice, so the hook tests the transition, not the state. The `aggregateId` is the **content-uuid**, never the row id: a peer reconciles by content, and a local id means nothing to it.

Composes: [[sale]] · [[law]].
