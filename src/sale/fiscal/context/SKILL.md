# context

Resolves the fiscal context of a sale: the tenant, the device, and the operator on whose authority the receipt is issued. Everything downstream is computed **against** this, so an unresolved or wrong context does not fail loudly — it fiscalises correctly-shaped documents against the wrong device.

Composes: [[sale]] · [[law]].
