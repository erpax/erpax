# generate/meta — a page's metadata is derived from the document, never typed twice

`generateMeta` builds the Next.js `Metadata` — title, description, Open Graph image — from the
Payload document being rendered. Image URLs are absolutised against the request origin, because
a relative URL in an Open Graph tag resolves against the consumer, not the page.
