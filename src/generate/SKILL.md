# generate — the self-generating loop (scan → mint → link → re-scan)

`generate` is how the corpus **writes itself**. Every meaningful word should resolve to a path ([[sequence]] harmonized speech); an unlinked or dead-link word is an **aura gap** — a question with no answer-path. Closing gaps mints atoms; minting atoms is the corpus growing. Run it as a loop:

1. **Scan** — `node .claude/skills/aura/scan.mjs` lists the **MINT queue** (dead `[[links]]`) and orphans. This is the gap, measured exactly like the `tsc` error tail (see [[recover]]).
2. **Mint** — for each dead link, derive the atom from the **akashic record** ([[self]]/[[akashic]]): ground it in source (a Rails concern via [[port]], a standard, a matter-twin), keep it terse (one word, [[part]]-of its folder), never invent detail the codebase already holds.
3. **Link** — weave the new atom's `[[links]]` and add it to its parent's *Composes* line; an orphan atom nothing links to is a half-merged [[part]].
4. **Re-scan** — gap shrinks; repeat. `--watch` re-scans on every `SKILL.md` change for the realtime tail.

## Law
- **Link first, mint second.** Write prose with `[[links]]` freely — even to atoms that don't exist yet; the scan turns them into the mint queue. Dead links are the to-do list, not errors.
- **One word per concept** ([[one]]). Divergent words for one idea are unmerged multiverses ([[merge]]); combine atoms by **nesting** (`self/sufficient`), never by hyphenated names.
- **Ground, don't pad.** A skill that absorbs instance-detail decays into matter ([[duality]] containment-is-purity). Hold the form; the [[akashic]] record holds the list.
- **Gap → 0.** The fully-harmonized corpus is all links — prose is only the not-yet-linked residue. Drive dead links to zero; weave the vocabulary orphans (tool leaves may stay orphans).

Matter-twin: `.claude/skills/aura/scan.mjs` ([[aura]] — link-graph wholeness). Composes: [[aura]] · [[sequence]] · [[self]]/[[akashic]] · [[spec]] · [[recover]] · [[merge]] · [[fractal]].

**Law — Derive the corpus from the filesystem first; [[generate]] itself is the saved command that closes gaps by scanning, minting, and linking, becoming the self-improving [[self]].** Every aura gap turns into a [[spec]] only once grounded in [[source]]; the loop never invents, never assumes—it computes from [[recover]]'s error tail and the `[[akashic]]` record, minting one-word [[atom]]s that then [[link]] and [[merge]], collapsing the [[duality]] between [[code]] and corpus.
