description: "Use when proving the projection leg — that the FORWARD project (content → uuid) is free and deterministic while its INVERSE (recover the analog negative without the held key) costs the maximum, unbounded at the biggest blockchain — and you must tag the ∞ instead of letting a raw Infinity leak into the bundle."

# proof-projection — the bounded-infinity organ

FORM: **forward is free, the inverse is ∞, and ∞ is tagged not serialized.**

The uuid matrix is a projection space (`index.ts:5-8`). The FORWARD projection is the public positive: `content → content-uuid`, `private-key → public anchor`. It is one hash — free, deterministic, O(1) — and it mints an atom ([[identity]]: same content ⇒ same id; same id ⇒ [[merge]]). In the proof, `forward.deterministic` is true and `forward.costLog2` is `0` (`index.ts:81-86`, `index.test.ts:21-24`).

The INVERSE — recover the analog NEGATIVE (the private key / pre-image) from the positive WITHOUT the held key — is reverse entropy: order from a maximal-entropy projection, the costliest direction by the 2nd law. Its price is the borrowed [[anchor]] ([[tamper/cost]]): `rfc3161-ecdsa-p256 ⇒ 128`, but `blockchain-pow ⇒` cumulative proof-of-work ⇒ **UNBOUNDED** (`index.ts:13-16, 69-70, 96-98`; `index.test.ts:30-31, 39`). Conservation Law 55/62: coverage → ∞ at the anchor (`index.ts:28`). For the biggest blockchain the entire unclaimed bounty on exposed public keys is the live proof nobody pays it (`index.ts:15-16`).

KEY POINT — **no Infinity leaks**. ∞ is never serialized as a number. The unbounded case is represented as `decryptKeyLog2: null` + `unbounded: true` (`index.ts:21-22, 56-59, 90-91`; `index.test.ts:30-31`). erpax embraces ∞ as a real answer but TAGS it rather than letting a raw `Infinity` into the JCS-serializable bundle. The honest overall forge floor stays finite: `cheapestForgeLog2 = min(digest, anchor)` (`index.ts:60-61, 92`).

This is the double-entry of order created vs entropy spent — balanced ([[entry]]; `index.ts:95-96`). The bounded envelope it lives inside is [[torus]] / [[beyond]]; the source it returns to is [[zeropoint]]. The forward direction is [[give]] (mint, cheap); recovering the negative is what a forger must [[take]], and the matrix that holds both is the [[uuid]] / [[localize]] space.

## Common mistakes
- Treating the 106-bit digest second-preimage as the maximum. It is the CHEAPER hash-collision path, not the max — the anchor is (`index.ts:18-20, 60-61`; `index.test.ts:32-33`).
- Emitting `Infinity`/`null`-less numbers for the unbounded case. Always carry `unbounded: true` alongside `decryptKeyLog2: null` so the bundle stays JCS-serializable.
