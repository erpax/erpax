# confirm/matter — the lane that needs the app

[[confirm]]/uuid proves the substrate without Payload. This is the other half: the checks that only mean something against the built application — Payload types, the VitePress docs twin, the build gate — run scoped to the files a turn actually touched, or `--full` across the corpus.

Scoping is the point. A hook that re-checked everything on every write would cost more than the defect it catches, and a gate that costs too much is a gate that gets skipped ([[rules]]). `scopeFiles` narrows to the changeset; `--full` is the deliberate whole-corpus pass the push gate runs.

`outsideMatter` refuses to judge files outside the repo root (a temp path is not this corpus), and `touchesStandardBanner` decides whether the statutory index must be re-emitted — the citation trace has to stay resolvable ([[rules]]/reference).

Composes: [[confirm]] · [[gate]] · [[rules]].
