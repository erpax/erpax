# confirm/push — a green seal lands itself

When a turn leaves a complete sealed tree, this is what saves it: `confirm --full`, then commit (firing pre-commit), then push (firing pre-push). Only a GREEN seal may commit; an unsealed tree is left exactly as it was.

It runs DETACHED so a turn never blocks on the integration lane, and a single lock keeps two waves from interleaving.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the seal was green *at the moment it ran*, never that the push will survive CI — the remote gate is a different environment and remains the final arbiter.

Composes: [[confirm]] · [[gate]] · [[seal]].
