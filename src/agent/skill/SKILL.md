# agent/skill — an agent loads a capability

An agent loads a **skill** (a capability) by name/route: the agent's competence is the **union** of its loaded skills — [[team]] / [[holographic]] (a skill one agent loads, the team has). Loading is **idempotent** (set union), so re-loading is free and two agents converge on the same competence by [[merge]]. This is the `src/agent/[skill]` capability — the agent's loadout over the skill corpus.

Matter-twin: `src/agent/skill/index.ts` (`AgentSkills` · `agentSkills` · `load` · `has`). Composes [[agent]] · [[team]] · [[holographic]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: an agent's competence is the UNION of its loaded skills (a skill one agent loads, the [[team]] has); loading is idempotent (set union), so re-loading is free and two agents converge on the same competence by [[merge]].**
