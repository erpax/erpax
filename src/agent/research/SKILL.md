# agent/research — the R&D society (an agent IS a user)

The actor-[[merge]] made operational: to register an agent is to ensure a tenant [[user]] row, its global role mapped to a capability through the access [[cross]] (the angelic hierarchy), its per-tenant seat enforced by the multi-tenant plugin. A finding is a content-addressed Discovery on the chat bus, so the same find by two agents merges to one; approval is the tenant-admin gate turned into a [[receipt]] that chains into the uuid-linked [[audit]] — forging an approval rewrites every downstream leaf. The pure core (society, [[identity]], finding, approval decision) is unit-testable without booting Payload.

Matter-twin: `src/agent/research/index.ts` — `researchSociety` · `memberCapability` · `isApprover` · `agentEmail`/`agentSlug` · `findingUuid`/`findingToDiscovery` · `approveFinding`/`approveFindings` · `ensureTenant`/`ensureMemberUser`/`registerResearchSociety`. Composes [[agent]] [[identity]] · the [[cross]] (role→capability) · [[receipt]] (the audited approval) · [[tenant]] · [[user]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: an [[agent]] IS a [[user]] (the actor-merge), so a finding is content-addressed (same find ⇒ one row) and only a tenant-admin approver may issue the allow-[[receipt]] that lets it LAND — the gate chains into the uuid-linked [[audit]], tamper-evident end to end.**
