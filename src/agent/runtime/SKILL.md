AgentRuntime — dispatches chain steps + events + scheduled ticks to the owning DomainAgent and processes its returned effects.

Extracted from `agent/runtime.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[agent]].
