# agent/sync/depth — a constant that depends on nothing, reachable without depending on anything

`MAX_BROADCAST_DEPTH` is the integer 32. It used to live in `chat-broadcast.ts`, a file deep inside the corpus's largest import tangle — so [[team]]/comms, which takes **one symbol**, inherited `@/ai/industry`, `@/agent`, `effect-processor`, `context` and `payload-chat` along with it.

Moving it to a module with **zero imports** is the cut. Importing this adds no edge, which is the only property that matters here and the one its test pins:

```
largest import SCC   249 → 57 files
fatal top-level uses  42 → 24
```

Those three cuts are `@/website` → `@/website/seo`, `@/integrity` → `@/integrity/content`, and this one. `chat-broadcast.ts` re-exports the constant, so everything reading it from `@/agent/sync` is unchanged.

`withinBroadcastDepth` is the comparison the guard actually makes — exclusive at the bound, and refusing a non-integer or negative depth rather than coercing it.

**Honest boundary.** This removes an EDGE; it does not remove the tangle. Two components of 57 and 53 files remain, and 24 top-level uses still run a binding from their own component at load time. What it does prove is that the cut points are findable and lawful: a leaf sub-atom satisfies the cycle law and the import-purity law at once.

**Law — [[law]]: a constant that depends on nothing must be reachable without depending on anything. A zero-import module is a valid cut point in any tangle.**

Composes: [[agent]]/sync · [[team]]/comms · [[rules]]/cycle · [[law]].
