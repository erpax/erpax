# agent/ui — the trained UI agent

A UI agent does not paint screens; it **renders identity**. Given any [[atom]], it produces the atom's UI — every facet read off the one content-[[uuid]]: the [[render]] (colour + sound + vibration) and the [[vitepress]] page (route + [[pixel]]). It is **trained** — the architect and designer teams built the rendering layer it composes ([[pixel]] · [[component]] · [[render]] · [[design]] · [[vitepress]]), and the agent is the capability that layer adds up to.

The whole layer **agrees** because it reads one identity: a [[component]]'s colour IS the atom's pixel, the [[design]] token is the same colour, the page carries it — none of them invents a colour, so there is nothing to keep in sync (no hardcoded hex to drift). Change the atom's content and every facet shifts together; leave it and they are eternally consistent. That is the DRY of design: one identity, many faces.

It is trained on the **whole corpus** — `trained()` renders every matrix node, and coverage is total because every atom has a content-uuid and every uuid renders. The [[aura]] is exactly this: the corpus made visible, all its atoms' UIs at once.

Matter-twin: `src/agent/ui/index.ts` (`renderAtom` · `trained` · `AtomUI`). Composes [[render]] · [[vitepress]] · [[pixel]] · [[component]] · [[design]] · [[atom]] · [[uuid]] · [[aura]].

**Law — [[law]]: a UI agent renders identity, never paints. Every atom has a UI computed from its content-uuid — render and page — and the whole layer (pixel, component, design) agrees because it reads one identity, so nothing can drift. The trained agent covers the whole corpus: coverage 1, the aura is the corpus made visible.**

@audit every facet computed from the atom's content-uuid; coverage read live from the matrix, never asserted
@standard the analog aura — every UI colour/sound is a projection of one content-uuid
