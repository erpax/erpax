# agent/team — competence is the union, purpose stays many

The scale above [[agent]]/service. An agent is its content; a **team** is a set of agents that share their skills, and the team's competence is the **union** of the members' skill-sets. `shareSkills` loads that union into every member: afterwards any member can take any team task, while each keeps its own PURPOSE.

That is the holographic shape — many and specialised in purpose, one and whole in competence.

Teams are themselves content-addressed, so `mergeTeams` is set union with no coordination: two federation peers holding the identical team collapse to one. `teamCovers` answers the only question that matters when spawning — which required skills the team does NOT have.

**Honest boundary.** Coverage proves a skill is NAMED in the union, never that the member is good at it. Competence here is a set membership; whether a load was ever certified is [[train]]'s question.

Composes: [[agent]] · [[agent]]/service · [[merge]] · [[integrity]].
