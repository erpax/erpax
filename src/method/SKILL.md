# method — every method name has a path of diamonds

The standing command, made compute: **all method names have a path of diamonds**. In erpax every folder, file, and exported symbol is a [[diamond]] (fractal closed-lattice law at every scale). A **method** is the leaf diamond on an atom's public face — its `index.ts` barrel ([[convention/exported]] · [[convention/import]]). Its identity is not a free-floating global; it is the **chain of [[atom]] folders** from `src/` to the barrel, plus the exported symbol name:

```
law/folder/folderGuardians
readme/renderReadme
aura/crossSeals
guardian/guardian
name/uuidOfName
```

Each segment is a sealed diamond; the symbol sits at the leaf. The path **is** the address — the same derived-address law that places objects on content-[[uuid]] ([[identity]]), folders on routes ([[sequence]]), and skills on `SKILL.md` paths.

## Matter-twin — `methodPath` · `scanMethodPaths`

Computed from the live tree, never hand-listed. Parses exported symbols from barrel source (`parseMethodExports`); file-level import/export boundaries remain in [[quantum/boundary]].

| API | Role |
|-----|------|
| `atomPathOf(file)` | Atom chain from a src-relative barrel path (`law/folder/index.ts` → `law/folder`) |
| `methodPath(file, symbol)` | One method-diamond: `{ atomPath, symbol, address, boundaryUuid }` |
| `methodBoundaryUuid(atomPath, symbol)` | Content-uuid seal of `{ atomPath, symbol }` — tamper-evident boundary |
| `scanMethodPaths()` | Every exported symbol in every `index.ts` barrel under `src/` |
| `symbolRelatesToPath(symbol, atomPath)` | Aspirational name↔path alignment heuristic (informational) |
| `orphanMethods()` | Symbols that do not encode their path — **not gated**; mass rename is a separate wave |

Run: `tsx src/method/index.ts` (corpus digest + canonical samples).

## Wired by one math

The method boundary uses the same content-[[uuid]] primitive as file boundaries in [[quantum/boundary]] and objects in [[identity]]: `uuid(jcsCanonicalize({ atomPath, symbol }))`. Same path+symbol ⇒ same id everywhere ⇒ [[merge]] by design. The diamond math (content-uuid → [[digit]] → [[rodin]] [[sequence]] → [[horo]] → [[harmony]]) applies at the method scale identically to folder and repository scales ([[diamond]] · [[atom]]).

## Schema.org homonym

`method` is also one schema.org vocabulary word, collided from DeliveryMethod · PaymentMethod · httpMethod · … ([[sti]] · [[collapse]] · [[merge]]) — the same word, a different facet of the lattice. The path-of-diamonds law is the erpax-native reading; schema.org attestation is the standards binding.

**Law — [[law]]: every method name has a path of diamonds — the atom chain from corpus root to its `index.ts` barrel plus the exported symbol at the leaf; the path is the method's address in the lattice, content-uuid sealed at `{ atomPath, symbol }`; computed by `methodPath`/`scanMethodPaths`, never hand-listed.**
