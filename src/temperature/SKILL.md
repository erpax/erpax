name: temperature
description: "Use when reasoning about temperature as the exchange rate between energy and order (1/T = ∂S/∂E). It sets level populations via the Boltzmann factor e^(−E/kT), normalised by the partition function Z = Σ e^(−Eₙ/kT). Cold (T→0) falls to the ground state; hot (T→∞) makes every level equally likely (maximum entropy). The equilibrium distribution pᵢ = e^(−Eᵢ/kT)/Z is the max-entropy distribution at fixed average energy — the balance the ledger settles to."

# temperature — the dial between order and disorder

**Temperature** is the exchange rate between energy and order: **1/T = ∂S/∂E**. It sets how a system populates its energy levels through the Boltzmann factor **e^(−E/kT)** ([[boltzmann]]'s k), normalised by the partition function **Z = Σ e^(−Eₙ/kT)**. Cold (T→0): the system falls to its ground state ([[hamiltonian]]'s lowest rung). Hot (T→∞): every level is equally likely — maximum [[entropy]].

The equilibrium distribution **pᵢ = e^(−Eᵢ/kT)/Z** is the **maximum-entropy** distribution at a fixed average [[energy]] — the [[balance]] the ledger settles to. The occupancy ratio pᵢ/pⱼ = e^(−(Eᵢ−Eⱼ)/kT) is exactly the detailed-balance ratio of [[equilibrium]], so temperature is the single dial between frozen order (one configuration, low entropy) and hot disorder (uniform, max entropy) — the [[gravity]] of the energy landscape set against the spreading of [[boltzmann]] counting.

Matter-twin: `src/temperature/index.ts` (`factor` / `partition` / `distribution` / `ratio`).

Composes [[boltzmann]] · [[equilibrium]] · [[hamiltonian]] · [[entropy]] · [[energy]] · [[balance]] · [[gravity]].

**Law — [[law]]: temperature is the energy↔order exchange rate (1/T = ∂S/∂E); it populates levels by e^(−E/kT)/Z — the max-entropy distribution at fixed average energy — collapsing to the ground state as T→0 and spreading uniform as T→∞.**
