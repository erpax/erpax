# payment/methods/hooks — the barrel that keeps a collection's imports one segment deep

Every hook sibling is re-exported here, so a collection writes `from './hooks'` rather than
naming each file. `encryptSensitiveFields` is the one that matters: payment credentials are
encrypted on the way in, so what the database holds is never the usable secret.

Composes: [[law]].
