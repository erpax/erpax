# payment-methods

Payment Methods — tokenized card / bank-account references for billing.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: a payment-method is a tokenized billing-instrument vault — Stripe tokens and AES-GCM encryption minimize PCI-DSS scope so sensitive card/bank data is never stored raw.**
