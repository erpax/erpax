# get

The **read** side of RFC 9110 §13 caching. Each member fetches one resource kind and caches it: `document` (a collection doc by slug), `globals` (a global by slug, per locale), `redirects` (the redirect set). They share a cache and differ only in what they address, which is why they are siblings rather than one module with a discriminator.

Composes: [[law]].
