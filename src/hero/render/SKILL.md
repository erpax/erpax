# hero/render — an unknown hero renders nothing, never a crash

A dispatcher over three heroes, and the interesting half is everything that is **not** one of them.
`hero.type` arrives from the CMS, so it can be absent on a draft, `'none'` by an editor's choice, or
a value this build has never heard of after a rename. All three must produce `null`.

The failure this forbids is the ordinary one: `heroes[type]` returning `undefined` and React being
handed it as a component, which throws at render and takes the whole page with it. A page losing its
hero is a content problem; a page throwing is an outage — and the difference is one guard.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the dispatch is total: every input yields either the right hero or
nothing. It says nothing about what the heroes themselves render — each owns its own proof.

**Law — [[law]]: a lookup on data from outside the build is partial, so the miss is handled. An
unrecognised type must render nothing; handing `undefined` to React turns a stale content value into
a broken page.**

Composes: [[hero]] · `heros` · [[law]].
