# orchestrate — orchestrate quantum computation across all problems in all directions

Orchestration engine that decomposes the seven Millennium Prize Problems into quantum-computable subproblems, spawns parallel quantum workers, aggregates results, and publishes findings to Zenodo.

## when

Use when launching the quantum computation wave: each problem is decomposed into independent subproblems, each spawned as a quantum worker task, results fused in a mesh, intermediate findings published, and the loop repeats until convergence or proof emerges.

## architecture

```
Orchestrator (main loop)
  ├─ Problem Loader: read millennium/* definitions
  ├─ Decomposer: break each into quantum-computable units
  ├─ Mesh Spawner: create graph nodes for each subproblem
  ├─ Worker Pool: quantum agents working in parallel
  ├─ Aggregator: fuse results via double-entry ledger
  ├─ Validator: check for convergence/proof
  └─ Publisher: commit to Zenodo + local ledger
```
