# canonical — use the package or drop it

Minimum tokens come from **minimum prose and maximum code**. "Use packages canonically" as prose costs ~550 tokens in every agent's system prompt, on every turn, forever — and still relies on the agent choosing to obey. As a **gate** it costs zero tokens and cannot be violated ([[rules]]: a law is obeyed only when a gate blocks its violation, not when it is written down).

The violation is mechanical: a governed dependency whose exports are never called in hand-written `src/`. It was real three times:

| package | the hand-roll beside it |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin-nested-docs` | 9 collections hand-rolled a self-referential `parent` tree — now wired computed in `payload.config.ts` |
| `plugin-multi-tenant` | *imported* but never called, beside a hand-rolled `tenantCollectionsConfig` |
| `plugin-seo` | installed, never called |

- `exportNamesOf(pkgDir)` — the package's own type face is the authority on its API. `r2Storage` cannot be derived from `@payloadcms/storage-r2`, so the name is never guessed.
- `unwiredPackages(cwd)` — governed deps (`@payloadcms/plugin-*`, `@payloadcms/storage-*`) with no call site. **An import is not use** — the call is. Generated bundles (`skills.index.ts`, `payload-types.ts`) restate every symbol, so they are not evidence.
- `assertPackagesCanonical(cwd, ceiling)` — ratchets: fails on getting worse, the ceiling drops as each is wired or dropped.

**Honest boundary.** This proves a package is *called*, never that it is called *well* — extending through a plugin's override API vs fighting it is beyond the gate. And a package with no readable API face is never judged rather than guessed at.

**Law — [[law]]: an installed package is used through its own API or dropped — a dependency whose exports are never called is dead weight or a re-implementation of what it already ships.**

Composes: [[rules]] · [[law]].
