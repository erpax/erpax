# uuid/kv — a key-value pair is uuid → uuid, so a mapping is addressable like anything else

`computeKvBindingUuid` addresses the binding itself, `toUuidMap` lifts a plain map into
`UuidMap`, and `resolveKeyUuid` finds the value for a key by address rather than by string.

Once the key and the value both have addresses, the mapping between them is a `KvBinding` that
can be signed, chained and compared like any other content — instead of being configuration that
nothing verifies.
