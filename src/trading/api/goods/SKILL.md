# trading/api/goods

The **goods** slice of the trading-API registry — reference entries (provider ·
region · category · endpoints · auth) split from the hub so its index.ts stays a
thin barrel ([[rules]]/concentration). Pure data; the parent [[trading]]/api owns
the query functions and concatenates money ⊕ goods into TRADING_APIS.

Composes: [[trading]].
