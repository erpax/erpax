# sanctions — real EU sanctions screening

The first notary check **actually wired to live data**. Before a notary seals, it screens the parties against sanctions/PEP lists (AMLD5 customer due diligence). This atom does it for real:

- **Authoritative source** — the EU Financial Sanctions Files, published by the European Commission (`webgate.ec.europa.eu`) with the *published* public token `token-2017`. Verified live 2026-07-15.
- **Delivery** — OpenSanctions redistributes the same list as a stable, versioned bulk dataset. We resolve the current `names.txt` through the dataset **index** (so we always screen against today's list — verified `version 20260715…`), fetch it, normalise, and match.
- **Matter-twin** — `src/notary/check/sanctions/index.ts`: `fetchSanctionsNames` · `resolveNamesUrl` · `normalize` · `screen` · `sanctionsAdapter` (implements the [[notary]]/check `ProviderAdapter`). The `fetch` is injectable, so the tests are deterministic and never touch the network; the endpoints themselves are verified reachable.

`ok:true` = the subject is **not** on the list (clear). `ok:false` = a name match to **escalate for manual review**. An unreachable list **throws** — a seal is never issued on a fabricated check.

**Honest boundary.**
- **Screening, not adjudication** — a hit is a review signal, never a verdict. v1 matches normalised full names (diacritics/case/punctuation folded); production adds fuzzy/token-set matching and secondary identifiers (birthdate, nationality) to cut false positives.
- **Licence** — OpenSanctions bulk data is **CC-BY-NC**: free for non-commercial use; a business must acquire a data licence, or ingest the EU FSF endpoint directly (no per-record licence).
- **Performance** — production ingests the list periodically into storage and screens against the index; it does not fetch ~1 MB per notarial act (pass a cached `names` list).

**Law — [[law]]: screen before you seal, against the authoritative list, and escalate rather than fabricate. A sanctions hit is a review signal, not a judgment; a seal must never issue over an unscreened or unreachable list.**

## Standards

- **AMLD5 — Directive (EU) 2018/843** — sanctions / PEP screening within customer due diligence.
- **EU Consolidated Financial Sanctions List (CFSP)** — the authoritative source, European Commission.
