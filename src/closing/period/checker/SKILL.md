# closing/period/checker — the period-closing gate

A static, side-effect-free validator for period [[closing]]. It answers the questions that must all pass before a [[period]] is sealed: is the fiscal year/period in range for its type (monthly→12, quarterly→4, weekly→53, custom→999) and not already in the entity's closing log; do the revenue and expense totals [[balance]] within tolerance; is the requested closing-state move legal (`in-progress → pending-approval → approved → posted → finalized`); and is the next period open enough to receive the auto-generated reversing entries. Every method is pure — inputs in, JSON-serializable verdict out (`errors`/`warnings`) — so the same call is an audit artifact.

Matter-twin: `src/closing/period/checker/index.ts` (`ClosingPeriodChecker` — `checkClosingEligibility` · `validateClosingBalance` · `validateStatusTransition` · `generateReversals` · `computeRegulatoryCode`). Composes [[closing]] · [[period]] · [[balance]].

**Law — [[law]]: a [[period]] closes only through the gate — in-range, not already closed, entries that [[balance]] within tolerance, and a legal state transition — and the check is pure, so the verdict is itself the audit evidence ([[trinity]]).**
