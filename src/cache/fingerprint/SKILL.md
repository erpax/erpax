# cache/fingerprint — reuse the whole-corpus scan, never re-derive it

A dozen derivations each pay the same 8–27s whole-tree scan (the rules snapshot, the readme typography graph, the corpus context). Re-running them is the cost the session named: the machine re-deriving what it already computed, and — worse — the **agent** waiting and re-reading, which is **billed in tokens**. This atom is the shared primitive so the FIRST caller computes and every sibling reuses.

`corpusFingerprint(cwd)` = file count + newest src mtime. The reuse rests on a theorem: **same fingerprint ⇒ same tree ⇒ same derivation**, so a memo keyed by it can never serve stale data — any edit bumps the mtime and forces a fresh compute. `memoByFingerprint(name, cwd, compute)` runs `compute` at most once per fingerprint; it holds any value, including non-serializable ones (a resolver closure, a graph), which the disk tier cannot.

This is the **compute-tier of "learn by shared experience"** — one scan, shared, instead of N re-derivations — and the one buildable lever from the AI-bill research: it moves corpus re-derivation off the agent's wait-and-re-read. The fingerprint had been copied into skill-context and readme/compute; this folds it to one home ([[rules]]/unfolded).

**Honest boundary.** In-process only: within one process, N callers collapse to one scan. Across processes (separate vitest workers) the memo does not share — that needs the **disk tier** (a JSON cache keyed by the same fingerprint), which works only for serializable results (`compactRulesSnapshot`) and is the next fold. And a memo is correct only while the fingerprint is honest: a change the fingerprint cannot see (an env var, a non-`src` input) would not invalidate it — so this is for pure whole-`src` derivations only.

**Law — [[law]]: a whole-corpus derivation is computed once per unchanged tree and reused. The fingerprint is the proof of freshness; reuse keyed by it is exact, and it moves re-derivation off the AI's bill.**
