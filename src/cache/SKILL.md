# cache

Use when optimizing repeated access — cache invalidation strategies, cache-aside vs write-through, TTL/expiry, cache coherency, memoization, query result caching, distributed cache semantics (Cloudflare KV, Redis).

Composes: [[bindings]] · [[optimize]] · [[queries]] · [[holographic]].

**The twin (MLA / DeepSeek-OCR).** DeepSeek compresses the *recompute*: Multi-head Latent Attention stores a low-rank latent instead of the full KV cache; DeepSeek-OCR stores long context as an image (optical compression). Both are this atom's store-less-recompute-cheaper move — keep the small seed, recompute the rest ([[holographic]]). Ratified by the R&D society (`agent/research`, weave seq 7).

## Standards
- HTTP caching (RFC 7234)
- Cache-Control headers
