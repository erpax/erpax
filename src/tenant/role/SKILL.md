# tenant/role — the reference profiles register themselves by being imported

Importing this barrel pulls in the four reference tenant profiles — business, payment provider,
bank, government — so any code holding the registry sees them without naming each.

A profile is what a tenant of that kind starts as. Keeping the four beside the registry is what
stops a fifth being invented ad hoc at a call site.

Composes: [[tenant]] · [[law]].
