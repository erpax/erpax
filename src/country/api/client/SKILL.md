description: Use when calling the public, no-auth and key-based official country APIs (VIES, Companies House, KvK, Brønnøysund, INSEE, BG Търговски Регистър, Peppol, EU/OFAC sanctions, БНБ/ECB FX) and resolving them through the EU national→pan-EU fallback chains.

# country/api/client — official country API clients (one file per auth pattern)

Working integrations with the catalogued official APIs, organised by *auth pattern* not by country: the catalogue is broad but the realised auth surface is narrow (no-auth JSON, key-in-query, SOAP). Every client returns `{ ok, data?, error?, source }` so the caller branches on success without exception flow, and `source` carries the publisher name for the audit trail. The EU-fallback resolvers try a country-specific publisher first and fall back to the pan-EU baseline (БНБ→ECB for FX, national register→VIES for VAT, national→EU consolidated for sanctions, national→Peppol Directory for e-invoicing), returning the first success so the [[country]] reconciliation path is one shape regardless of which authority answered.

Matter-twin: `src/country/api/client/index.ts` — `checkVies` · `lookupCompaniesHouse` · `lookupBrreg` · `lookupBnbExchangeRate` / `lookupEcbExchangeRate` · `lookupEuFallbackRate` · `validateBgVatId` / `validateBgEik` · `discoverBgAspsps` · `listAllCountryApis`, over the `@/country/api` catalogue.

**Law — [[law]]: every official-[[api]] call returns one `{ ok, data?, error?, source }` shape with `source` attributing the answering authority, and the EU fallback chain resolves national→pan-EU to the first success — so the [[country]] caller branches on one shape regardless of publisher or auth pattern.**
