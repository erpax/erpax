# country/api/eu

The **eu** slice of the country-authority API registry — reference entries
(registries · e-invoicing · VAT/VIES · payroll · banking rails) split from the hub
so its index.ts stays a thin barrel ([[rules]]/concentration). Pure data; the
parent [[country]]/api owns the lookup functions.

Composes: [[country]].
