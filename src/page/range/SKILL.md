# page/range — the paginator, exported from a barrel a server module can import

`PageRange` renders which slice of a result set is being shown. The component is `index.tsx`
because it is JSX; this barrel re-exports it so importers name the atom rather than the
spelling of its file.

Composes: [[law]].
