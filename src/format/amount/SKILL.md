# format/amount — money is integer cents in the system and a decimal string on the wire, converted in ONE place

`formatAmount` renders integer cents as a fixed-two-decimal string; `formatCurrency` adds the
code. Peppol UBL, ISO 20022, EDIFACT and SAF-T all need that wire form, and four serializers
each doing it themselves is four chances to round differently.

Composes: [[law]].
