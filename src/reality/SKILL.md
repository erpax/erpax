# reality — the live state, content-addressed

Reality is the **live, shipped state**: what is *actually* on main / [[deploy]]ed, as opposed to the model. The live [[matrix]] root is reality's fingerprint; a claim is **real** iff it matches the live root ([[anchor]] · [[verification]] · [[proof]]) — content-addressed truth, not assertion. Merging to main and deploying is the act of making the model real — the model **collapses** into the one true current state ([[quantum]]/reality).

Matter-twin: `src/reality/index.ts` (`realityRoot` · `isReal`). Composes [[deploy]] · [[matrix]] · [[anchor]] · [[verification]] · [[quantum]].

**Law — [[law]]: reality is the live shipped state (what is actually on main / [[deploy]]ed), the live [[matrix]] root its fingerprint — a claim is real iff it matches that root ([[proof]]), content-addressed truth never assertion.**

@audit reality = the live matrix root; computed, never hand-asserted
