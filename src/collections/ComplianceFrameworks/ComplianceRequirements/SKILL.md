Compliance Requirements — per-requirement obligation register within a compliance framework.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards
- ISO-37301:2021 obligation-register
- SOX §404 control-objective
- ISO-27001 A.5.23 cloud-service-tenant-isolation
