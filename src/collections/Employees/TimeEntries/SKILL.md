# time-entries

Time Entries — per-day / per-task time records for payroll + project costing.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.
