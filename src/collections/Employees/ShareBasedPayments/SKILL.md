# share-based-payments

Share-Based Payments — IFRS 2 equity-settled & cash-settled employee compensation register.

One row per grant (stock options, RSUs, RSAs, PSUs, ESPPs, SARs). The `settlementType` discriminator drives whether the grant credits equity (IFRS 2 §10) or builds a liability (IFRS 2 §30). Vesting schedule captured as tranche array; expense recognised straight-line over each tranche per IFRS 2 §15.

The schema lives in `index.ts` (schema + standards banners), co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) in the same folder.
