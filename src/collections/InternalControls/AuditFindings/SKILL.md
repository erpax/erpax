# audit-findings

Audit Findings — issues raised by internal/external auditors against controls.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards
- ISO-19011:2018 audit-finding
- ISO/IEC-27007:2020 ISMS-auditing
- SOX §404 internal-controls deficiency-tracking
- ISO-19011:2018 audit-trail
