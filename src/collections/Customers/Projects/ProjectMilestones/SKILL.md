Project Milestones — IFRS-15 §126 milestone-billing trigger points.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Composition

Slice AAAA (2026-05-10): contracts that recognise revenue at discrete milestones (rather than over time via cost-to-cost) need a structured milestone register. When a milestone is marked `achieved`, the GL handler emits a `milestone:achieved` event that triggers invoicing + revenue recognition for the milestone amount.
