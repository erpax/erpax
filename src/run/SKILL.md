# run

A **run** is one bounded execution of a batch process — the singular model of the `runs` collection. A [[payment]] run (ISO 20022 pain.001/pain.008), a payroll run, a [[schedule|scheduled]] [[jobs|job]] run: each gathers a set, authorises it, executes once, and reconciles, moving along a draft → approved → executed → settled lifecycle ([[horo]]). One run is the unit a [[batch]] is initiated and accounted as ([[entry]] · [[balance]]).

The run is also the verb the corpus turns on itself — [[dev|run/dev]] launches the app to see a change work; a job run advances the [[society]] one gate-verified step. Same shape: a bounded pass with a precondition, an effect, and a reconciled result.

Composes: [[batch]] · [[payment]] · [[schedule]] · [[jobs]] · [[entry]] · [[balance]] · [[horo]].

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (the 7-dim instrument reads SKILL.md; these atoms declare these standards in this section) -->
- `@standard ISO-20022`

- ISO 20022 (pain.001 credit-transfer / pain.008 direct-debit batch initiation)

**Law — [[law]]: one run is one bounded pass of a batch process — gather a set, authorise, execute once, reconcile — moving along a draft → approved → executed → settled lifecycle ([[horo]]).**
