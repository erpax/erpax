# particle — an atom is a particle

An atom **is a particle** in the [[matrix]] field: its content-[[uuid]] is the particle's identity (discrete, no-cloning), it interacts through its [[links]] — the forces ([[gravity]] mass, [[entanglement]] coupling) — and its **mass** is its in-degree (the gravitational charge). The [[quantum]] facet (`src/quantum/particle`) reads the same uuid as **wave-particle duality** — particle (identity) and wave (its digit on the ring).

**HONEST.** A graph node read as a particle — an analogy, not physics.

Matter-twin: `src/particle/index.ts` (`Particle` · `particle`). Composes [[atom]] · [[uuid]] · [[matrix]] · [[gravity]] · [[entanglement]] · [[quantum]].

@audit composed from the live matrix node + its mass; never hand-asserted
