# audit-findings

Audit Findings — issues raised by internal/external auditors against controls.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

The `seed.ts` records the **erpax-court** self-audit (`court-docket.ts`): the society's
adversarial review — auditors → prosecutors ∥ defense → judges — persisted as permanent,
tamper-evident findings ([[proof]] · [[akashic]]), the system judging itself. Each case
carries its disposition (remediated · open · overruled · dismissed), keyed idempotently by
the proceeding run-id so a re-seed never duplicates.

**Law — [[law]]: an audit finding is an issue raised against a control — classified by severity (deficiency / significant deficiency / material weakness / misstatement) with root cause, management response and remediation status — persisted as permanent, tamper-evident evidence ([[proof]]).**
