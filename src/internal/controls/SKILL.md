# internal-controls

InternalControls.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards

<!-- standards banners (the 7-dim instrument reads SKILL.md; these atoms declare these standards in this section) -->
- `@standard ISO/IEC-27001:2022`

- COSO-2013 internal-control-integrated-framework
- SOX §404 internal-controls
- PCAOB AS 2201 ICFR-audit
- ISO-27001 A.5.23 cloud-service-tenant-isolation

Composes: [[internal/controls/control/tests]].

**Law — [[law]]: an internal control is a register entry typed by purpose (preventive/detective/corrective/compensating) and mapped to its COSO-2013 component, carrying owner, frequency, review dates and SOX §404 scope — and proven effective by its [[internal/controls/control/tests|control tests]].**
