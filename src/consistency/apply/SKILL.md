# consistency/apply — the deterministic gap-closing transforms

Each `apply*` function is a deterministic, idempotent rewrite that closes one class of code-consistency gap surfaced by the architecture-invariants. The contract is fixed: read source from disk, apply the rewrite, write back, return an `ApplySummary` of `(file, action, detail)` tuples for the MCP audit log. Idempotent — re-running on already-clean source is a no-op; safe — never touches anything outside its documented file set; auditable — every change is reported. `applyAllConsistencyFixes` runs every safe transform and aggregates the audit log; the `erpax.consistency.applyAll` MCP tool and the ConsistencyAgent's hourly cron dispatch to it. A `dryRun` flag computes the summary without writing, and a missing target directory yields the empty summary.

Matter-twin: `src/consistency/apply/index.ts` (`applyAllConsistencyFixes` ⊕ `applyChainProducerBackfill` · `applyEmitsLegacyToStructured` · `applyChainE2eSeedScaffold` · `applyChainShadcnSurfaceScaffold` · `applyLocalizedTrueFlag` · `applyEmergingGapScaffold` · `applyI18nHarvestDryRun`, all returning `ApplySummary`/`AppliedChange`). Composes [[consistency]] · [[apply]].

**Law — [[law]]: every consistency fix is a deterministic, idempotent, audited transform — read · rewrite · write-back · report — so re-running is a no-op and a missing target is the empty summary.**
