name: rate
description: Use when a value is a ratio of two dimensions pinned at a point in time — exchange rate, VAT/tax rate, interest rate, unit price (currency per quantity), wage (currency per hour), throughput/capacity (quantity per hour), run-time-per-unit. The RateConcern; a rate is value-per-unit, pinned at a point; blanks route to the no-op identity (cascade-resolved), never a magic literal.

# rate — a value per unit, pinned at a point in time

`rate` completes the value-quantification trio with [[currency]] (value-of-trade) and [[measure]] (value-of-substance): a **rate is one of those per a unit of the other** — a ratio. Exchange ([[currency]]/[[currency]]), unit price ([[currency]] per [[measure]] unit), wage ([[currency]] per time-unit `HUR`), throughput/capacity ([[measure]] per `HUR`), run-time-per-unit (time per [[measure]]), tax/discount/interest (per-hundred). Sequence position **1** ([[fields]]).

A rate is **always pinned at a point in time** ([[versions]]) — the БНБ→ECB exchange rate on the invoice date, the standard VAT rate resolved for the period, the standard-costing rate — never a frozen scalar. A blank rate routes to its **no-op identity element** ([[identity]]): `×1` for a conversion, `+0%` for a charge, otherwise the value resolved along the jurisdiction cascade. An ad-hoc literal default (`?? 0.21`, `?? '21.1'`) is impure antimatter — instance detail smuggled into the default ([[duality]] containment-is-purity) — and breaks the fractal; resolve it, never bake it.

Pervasive across both twins: [[currency]] `exchangeRate`, [[measure]] conversion factors, the [[manufacturing]] per-minute rates (`costPerMinute`·`pricePerMinute`·`payPerHour`·`capacityPerHour`·`runTimePerUnit`), VAT/tax rates, [[calculate]] present-value/depreciation/standard-costing variances. Where a [[hooks]] hook resolves the rate at write-time, the read needs no fallback at all.

Composes: [[currency]] · [[measure]] (the two dimensions a rate relates), [[number]], [[calculate]] (rates drive PV/variances), [[versions]] (point-in-time), [[identity]] (no-op element + cascade fallback), [[standard]], [[fields]] · [[currency/rates]] · [[value]].

## Common mistakes
- A magic-literal rate default (`?? 0.21`) — resolve via the cascade; blank routes to the no-op identity (`×1` / `+0%`).
- A rate stored without its point-in-time ([[versions]]) — yesterday's exchange/VAT rate silently reprices history.
- Storing a derived rate that should be computed from value ÷ quantity at read.
