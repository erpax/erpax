# social/graph — reciprocity is computed from the two edges, never stored as a third state

`connections` holds directed edges. `isReciprocal` asks whether the opposite edge exists, and
`resolveReciprocity` derives the relation: two mutual follows ARE a friendship, and nothing
writes a "friends" row to say so.

A stored third state is a copy of an answer, and copies go stale the moment one side unfollows.

Composes: [[law]].
