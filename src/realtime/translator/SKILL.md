# realtime/translator — translate the live tail

The [[realtime]] facet of the [[translator]]: as events arrive in the live tail, each message is reduced to its **language-independent meaning** (the interlingua meaning-uuid), so a subscriber in any of the EU languages reads the same thing — zero-shot, no per-pair model. Two live tails carry the same meaning when their interlingua sequences match.

Matter-twin: `src/realtime/translator/index.ts` (`interlinguaTail` · `sameMeaningTail`). Composes [[realtime]] · [[translator]] · [[eu]] · [[language]].
