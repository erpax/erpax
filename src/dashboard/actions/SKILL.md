# dashboard/actions — a document is created by a server action that books it, never by a form that posts fields

`createJournalEntryAction`, `createSalesInvoiceAction` and `createVendorBillAction` take a
typed input and return an `ActionResult`. Each validates, creates the document, and lets the
collection's own hooks do the posting — so a dashboard cannot write an unbalanced entry by
bypassing the ledger.

The inputs are the boundary: `JournalEntryLineInput`, `SalesInvoiceInput`, `VendorBillInput`.
Anything a caller sends outside them is not accepted, which is what keeps the action a door
rather than a passthrough.

Composes: [[law]].
