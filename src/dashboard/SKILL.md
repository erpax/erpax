# dashboard — each model's computed admin view (under [[before]])

FORM: **each [[model]] IS a Payload dashboard wired with all its related [[links]] and [[collections]].** A model's outbound [[links]] (computed by [[aura]] from its SKILL.md) are partitioned by the singular/plural matrix ([[translate]]): a link that is a registered [[collection]] slug (plural) is a related COLLECTION — paired with its model = `singularOf(slug)` — and every other link is a related [[model]]/atom. The view renders through REUSABLE components, and **each component is itself an [[atom]]** (single-word folder, the [[trinity]]). Computed, not hardcoded — a new [[link]] adds a card at zero cost.

**All computational; every atom is Open Graph + schema.org compatible in all dimensions.** Each card is a [[website]] seo-vortex face — `renderJsonLd` (schema.org JSON-LD) + `renderOgMeta` (Open Graph) — so the same atom is the VitePress page, the Payload row, the search doc, AND the OG/LD object, all computed from its content-[[identity]] (`contentUuid` + `name` + `description`), never duplicated per surface.

Matter-twin: `src/dashboard/index.tsx` — the admin `Dashboard` component + `formatCurrency`, plus `modelDashboard` (partition links → related collections + models). Pure; the links + slugs come from [[aura]] + the collections registry. Rendered by component-atoms hosted in [[before]]/dashboard.
Composes: [[before]] · [[model]] · [[collection]] · [[collections]] · [[links]] · [[aura]] · [[translate]] · [[website]] · [[components]] · [[atom]] · [[trinity]] · [[identity]].

## Standards
- WAI-ARIA 1.2 (the rendered panel) · schema.org + Open Graph (every atom, via seo-vortex) · the singular/plural matrix ([[translate]])

## Common mistakes
- Hardcoding a model's related collections — they are COMPUTED from its [[links]] ∩ the registered collection slugs.
- A component that is not an atom — every reusable component is a single-word [[atom]] (folder + [[trinity]]).

**Law — [[gate]]** Each model's dashboard is its computed neighbourhood — every related link resolves, partitioned into collection (plural) or model (singular), rendered by component-atoms, each atom Open-Graph + schema.org compatible — or the view is hand-wired (entropy > 0).
