# dashboard/spec — a widget is pure, so the page decides what it costs to render

The corpus grew two widget shapes: one taking props, one fetching its own data over REST. The
second makes a dashboard's cost invisible — every widget opens its own request, and nothing
can see the total.

One rule collapses them: **widgets are pure**. A `WidgetSpec` declares its `DataSource`
(`LocalApiSource`, `ServiceSource`, `McpSource`) and receives already-resolved data. The
`DashboardSpec` composes them, `widgetVisible` decides what this `DashboardContext` may see,
and the fetching happens once, where it can be counted.

Composes: [[law]].
