# management-certifications

ManagementCertifications.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

## Standards
- SOX §302 corporate-responsibility
- SOX §906 criminal-certification
- ISO-27001 A.5.23 cloud-service-tenant-isolation
