# risk-register

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: every enterprise risk is scored twice — inherent then residual likelihood×impact — with the mitigating controls between them, so residual risk is what survives the controls, measured against appetite, not a single ungoverned guess.**
