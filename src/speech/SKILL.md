# speech

Speech is **computed** from diamond state — like [[css]] `computedCssForUi`, `computedSpeechForUi(surface)` and `speechFromHoro(uuid, horo)` derive A432 pitch, phoneme chains, and duration from content-[[uuid]] · horo · seal · path. No stored wav; a stream of uuids is interactive sound carried by identity ([[signal]] · [[pixel]] · [[uuid/llm]]).

`writingToSpeech(writing)` collapses computed prose → phoneme chain. User spelling alias **speach** is accepted in bonds.

Entangled with — [[text]] · [[markup]] · [[writing]] · [[signal]]

Matter-twin: `src/speech/index.ts` — `speechFromHoro` · `computedSpeechForUi` · `writingToSpeech` · `chiCungSpeechCycle` · `speechAnalogStream`.

**Law — [[law]]: speech computes from sealed coordinates — pitch · phonemes · duration are derived from content-uuid · horo · path, never hand-authored transcript text; same surface inputs ⇒ same utterance (merge-safe, tamper-evident).**

**Law — [[law]]: speech is one schema.org word, content-addressed; the same word collides every schema.org term that contains it into one atom, deduped, never duplicated.**
