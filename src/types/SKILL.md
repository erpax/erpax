# types — Payload generated TypeScript

Payload generates `payload-types.ts` from the config (one interface per collection/global + union types like `CollectionSlug`). Regenerate after ANY schema change.

## Commands & config
| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| `payload generate:types` | Regenerate `payload-types.ts`. No-op (early return) if output is byte-identical to existing. |
| `config.typescript.outputFile` | Where types are written. |
| `config.typescript.declare` | Adds `declare module 'payload' { interface GeneratedTypes }` so Local API is typed. |
| `payload generate:importmap` | Separate — regenerates admin component import map. |

## Using the types
```ts
import type { Invoice, CollectionSlug } from '@/payload-types'
const res = await payload.find({ collection: 'invoices' }) // res.docs: Invoice[]
```
Relationship fields are `string | RelatedDoc` depending on `depth` — guard before accessing populated props.

## Toolchain notes (this repo)
- Use **TypeScript 5.7.3** (matches Payload 4's validated toolchain; TS 6.0.3-beta crashes `tsc` and Payload's compile step). Keep `ignoreDeprecations` out — fix deprecated options instead.
- Standalone `tsc` may need `node --stack-size=4000 .../tsc.js` on huge configs (see [[recover]]).

## Common mistakes
- Editing `payload-types.ts` by hand (regenerated/overwritten).
- Stale types after adding/renaming collections → slug literals rejected (`TS2322`/`2345`) until you re-run `generate:types`.
- Accessing populated relationship props without checking `depth` (value may be just an ID string).

**Law — [[law]]: `payload-types.ts` is generated from the config, never hand-edited; regenerate after ANY [[schema]] change or the stale types are a [[gate]]-caught gap.**
