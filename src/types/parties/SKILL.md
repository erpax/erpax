# types/parties — a payable and a receivable are the same document seen from opposite sides

Both are a dated, line-itemised financial document with a status lifecycle, a balance and an
aging profile. `PartyDocument` is that shape, `TransitionTable` the lifecycle it may walk, and
`DEFAULT_AGING_BUCKETS` the `BucketDefinition` set both age into.

Modelling them twice makes A/R and A/P able to disagree about what "overdue" means. Sharing the
shape leaves only the counterparty and the sign to differ, which is the actual difference.

Composes: [[law]].
