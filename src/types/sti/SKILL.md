# types/sti — one table, one discriminator, many subtypes — narrowed rather than cast

`STI_DISCRIMINATOR` names the column, `StiDoc` and `StiVariant` describe the union, and
`narrowSti`, `isStiType` and `matchStiType` narrow a row to its subtype without a cast.

Single-table inheritance is what stops a new subtype becoming a new table. The discriminated
union is what stops the caller guessing which fields a row has: the compiler knows, because the
discriminator says.

Composes: [[law]].
