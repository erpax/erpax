# types/receivables — what is owed to the business, and the allowance that admits some will not arrive

`Invoice`, `InvoiceLine`, `Customer` and `Payment` are the A/R side of the same party document;
`ARAgingReport` buckets it and `AllowanceResult` carries the expected-credit-loss figure IFRS 9
requires, which is the part a receivable cannot honestly omit.
