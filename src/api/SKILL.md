# api — Local / REST / GraphQL (position 7 of the material cycle)

Three interfaces, **one query syntax** (see [[queries]]). Same operations everywhere.

## Local API (fastest — no HTTP; use in server components, hooks, jobs)
```ts
const payload = await getPayload({ config })   // cached instance (see [[optimize]])
await payload.find({ collection, where, depth, select, limit, sort, locale, overrideAccess, req })
await payload.findByID({ collection, id })
await payload.create({ collection, data })
await payload.update({ collection, id|where, data })
await payload.delete({ collection, id|where })
await payload.count({ collection, where })
await payload.auth({ headers })                 // resolve req.user
payload.db.*                                    // bypass hooks/validation (see [[optimize]])
```
**Access is skipped by default in Local API** — pass `overrideAccess: false` (+ `user`/`req`) to enforce (see [[access]]).

## REST
Base `/api/<collection>`: `GET` (list/where), `GET /:id`, `POST`, `PATCH /:id`, `DELETE`. Query params: `where[...][operator]`, `depth`, `select`, `sort`, `limit`, `page`, `locale`. Custom routes via `config.endpoints` / collection `endpoints`.

## GraphQL
At `/api/graphql` (+ playground). Mirrors collections as queries/mutations. Cap cost with `graphQL.maxComplexity`, disable via `graphQL.disable` (see [[harden]]).

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting `overrideAccess: false` in Local API when you DO want access enforced.
- Re-instantiating Payload instead of cached `getPayload()`.
- Heavy populate via REST/GraphQL `depth` instead of `select`/`depth:0`.

**Law — [[law]]: three interfaces (Local/REST/GraphQL), one query syntax and one set of operations — the only divergence is that Local API skips access by default, so `overrideAccess: false` is what makes the three behave as one.**

All external APIs follow THE path — REST (`/api/…`), GraphQL, Local API, and [[mcp]] gateway routes normalize through `toAtomPath` in [[path]] and merge with [[fs]], [[github]], and docs [[url]] at one canonical atom path in every [[dimension]] (content-[[uuid]] entanglement; gates fail closed).
