# rich/text — an internal link is a route, never a stored URL

Lexical's serialized state becomes a React tree here. Most of that is the library's own default
converters; what this atom decides is the small part the library cannot know.

**Internal links.** An editor linking to another document stores a *relation*, not a URL — and that
is the right storage, because a slug can change and every stored copy of it would rot
([[rules]]/reference is the same law over file paths). So the href is derived at render:
`posts` become `/posts/<slug>`, everything else `/<slug>`.

The unresolved case is a **refusal**, not a guess. If the relation was not populated, the value is an
id rather than a document, and no slug exists — so it raises `INTERNAL_RICHTEXT_VALUE` instead of
emitting `/undefined` or an empty href. A link to nowhere renders as a real link and is discovered by
a reader; a raised error is discovered by whoever ships it.

**Blocks.** Banner, call-to-action, media and code blocks are erpax's own, so their converters are
registered here — the point at which editorial content and the component library meet.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the href derivation and the refusal. It does not verify the target
document exists — that is the relation's integrity, owned by the database — and it makes no claim
about the default converters, which belong to the editor package.

**Law — [[law]]: a link between documents is stored as a relation and resolved at render. Storing the
URL freezes a slug that is free to change, and an unresolvable relation must refuse rather than emit
a link that goes nowhere.**

## Standards

- **W3C HTML5** — rich-text output.
- **WCAG 2.2 §1.3.1 · §1.4.10** — info and relationships; reflow.

Composes: `rich` · [[error]] · `blocks` · [[law]].
