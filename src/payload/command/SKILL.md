# payload/command — the CLI command set, folded

The Payload CLI is a set of names, and in this corpus a [[name]] is a path is a content-[[uuid]] — so the commands fold like any atoms. Learned from the installed bin:

- **generators** — `generate:types` · `generate:importmap` · `generate:db` (forward-only: their inverse is the config they read, not another command)
- **migrations** — `migrate` · `migrate:create` · `migrate:status` · `migrate:down` · `migrate:fresh` · `migrate:refresh` · `migrate:reset`
- **runtime** — `jobs:run` · `jobs:handle` · `run` · `info`

`commandUuid` gives each command its content-uuid; `foldCommands` folds the whole set to **one root** by the [[merge]] — the command set's single identity.

**Both sides, for karmic balance** ([[karma]]). The reversible commands come in inverse pairs, and the corpus encodes both: `migrate` ↔ `migrate:down` (apply ↔ roll back), `migrate:fresh` ↔ `migrate:reset` (rebuild ↔ tear down). `inverseOf` returns a command's other side, or `undefined` for the forward-only generators. The [[deploy]] sequence opens with `migrate` — the first hop after the gate.

Matter-twin: `src/payload/command/index.ts` (`COMMANDS` · `PAIRS` · `commandUuid` · `foldCommands` · `inverseOf`). Composes [[payload]] · [[name]] · [[deploy]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: the Payload CLI command set, folded — each command is a name (name ≡ path ≡ uuid), the set folds to one root by the merge. Both sides encoded: every reversible command pairs with its inverse (migrate ↔ migrate:down, fresh ↔ reset); the generators are forward-only, their inverse the config they read.**

@audit the command list is the installed CLI's; each uuid and the fold are computed, never assumed
@standard the Payload CLI (generate / migrate / jobs / run) · double-entry (every reversible command has its inverse)
