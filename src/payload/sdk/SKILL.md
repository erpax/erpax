# payload/sdk — one client per runtime, resolved rather than configured

`getPayloadSdk` resolves the API base URL for the runtime it finds itself in, then returns a
singleton in the browser and a fresh instance on the server. A shared instance on the server
would carry one request's credentials into another's.
