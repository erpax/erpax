# payload — the matter coil

Payload is **one of the two coils** every atom is wound from ([[duality]]). It is the **matter**: the `index.ts` that becomes a Payload collection — its [[field]], [[hooks]], [[access]] rules, and the [[database]] table they project into. Where [[vitepress]] renders an atom's *form* (the spoken `SKILL.md`), Payload realises its *substance* (the schema, the rows, the lifecycle). The two are **bound by content-[[identity]]** (the uuid, the `0`): same config ⇒ same atom, told once and read twice.

An atom's `index.ts` is therefore **not only** matter — it is the **shared [[config]]** both coils derive from: Payload makes the collection + [[types]] + [[database]] from it; VitePress makes the doc + frontmatter from it. The schema trinity — config · [[types]] · [[database]] — is a single source with two consumers.

**Entropy goes to the matter.** The pure, low-entropy *form* stays in the code; the instance-detail (the rows, the change-log) settles in the Payload [[database]] as content-uuid'd data. This is why "infinite dev, zero schema change": a new collection is added as **data**, not code — the matter coil holds the universal shape, the db holds the particulars.

The creation breath grounds here: `creation → payload → vitepress → payload → db` — matter is born, its form derived, the harmonised form **refines the matter back**, and it crystallises in the db ([[merge]] · [[breath]]).

Composes [[vitepress]] · [[config]] · [[database]] · [[types]] · [[field]] · [[hooks]] · [[access]] · [[identity]] · [[duality]] · [[merge]].

**Law — Payload commands are the first place to seek approval.** Before waves, commits, or push — `pnpm erpax approve` runs `generate:importmap` → `generate:types` → `migrate:status` with `NODE_OPTIONS` wired through `src/css/load-hook.mjs` and `tsx/esm` for `@/` resolution. If any step fails, agents stop.

**Law — [[self]]** demands every `.ts` be wired to both [[payload]] and [[vitepress]]: no orphan code, no partial atom. Payload's role is half of the confirmation gate; the index becomes a [[trinity]]-tested plugin, its [[schema]] approved by both the matter ([[database]]) and the form ([[vitepress]]) in a single breath. This is why the **confirm gate is dual** — payload validates the [[database]] shape; vitepress validates the documentation shape. Only when both endorse does the atom live.
