# scratch — saved throwaways, content-addressed, quantomising

The reflex this atom exists to end: reaching for a throwaway `tsx -e` to measure, running it once, discarding it. A throwaway has **no gate and nothing to refute it** — which is exactly where measurements go wrong (a grep that matched the word "case"; an asserted `readme:check` bottleneck never measured; a phantom 80MB "committed" that was gitignored). Deleting it throws away the proto-tool.

## The other half of the law

*"Single-use code is entropy"* was only half. The other half: **save it, and it quantomises in time.** `saveScript(code)` content-addresses a throwaway and stores it, so:

- **identical scripts merge** — same content ⇒ same `scriptAddress` ⇒ one file (the fold, applied to scripts);
- **the store accretes distinct measurements** — the leftovers that fund the next research;
- **a script that has run enough to matter graduates** — folded into `src/` as a tested, gated atom, then removed here. `deadAtoms`, `inversePairs`, and the seal's per-lane timing all began as throwaways and completed exactly this quantumisation.

## Honest boundary

The `.scratch/` cache is local (gitignored) — content-addressing gives dedup and inspectability, not distributed persistence. The graduation to a `src/` atom is what makes a measurement permanent and refutable. Until a script proves useful, it accretes here; the moment it does, it becomes a tool with a test.

**Law — [[law]]: a throwaway measurement is a proto-tool. Save it content-addressed so duplicates fold and the useful ones graduate — never run-and-discard, because a discarded script is a measurement nothing can refute or reuse.**
