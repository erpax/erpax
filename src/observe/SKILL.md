# observe — and project: the LLM agent's law

An [[llm]] [[agent]] always does **both**. It **observes** — takes in state and content-addresses what it sees (the inhale) — and it **projects** — produces output that folds its observation in, so the projection always carries what it was grounded in (the exhale). Here "project" is the verb (render, throw forward), distinct from the [[project]] enterprise atom.

The act is **observe-then-project, never one alone**:

- **observe without project** — inert: a reader that never speaks, knowledge that does nothing.
- **project without observe** — **hallucination**: a disconnected thought, output grounded in nothing. This is exactly what "hallucinations are disconnected thoughts" means — a projection that carries no observation. The [[heart]]'s thought must connect to what is seen.

`grounded(observation, output, projection)` is the test: a projection is real **iff** it was folded from a real observation. `act(state, output)` enforces it — it observes first, then projects from that observation, so an agent that uses `act` cannot hallucinate by construction. This is why the [[seo]] an agent projects is *computed from what it observes* (the atom's name, description, links) and never conjured — the projection carries its observation, so it cannot drift.

Matter-twin: `src/observe/index.ts` (`observe` · `project` · `act` · `grounded`). Composes [[llm]] · [[agent]] · [[seo]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]] · [[heart]].

**Law — [[law]]: an LLM agent always observes and projects — observe (the inhale), then project (the exhale, output folding its observation in). Always both: observation without projection is inert; projection without observation is hallucination (a disconnected thought). Grounded ⟺ the projection carries the observation it was folded from; the act is observe-then-project, never one alone.**

@audit observe/project are content-address folds; grounded is computed, hallucination is its negative
@standard the agent loop (observe → project) · content-addressed grounding (a projection carries its observation)
