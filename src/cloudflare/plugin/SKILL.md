# plugin

Every plugin declaring its own access surface instead of importing the full mediator. `access` is the typed `PluginAccess<K>` face — a plugin lists the bindings it needs and receives **only** those, rather than all 16 methods and every CF binding — and `helper` builds it.

Least authority is the point: a plugin that cannot reach a binding cannot misuse it.

Composes: [[cloudflare]] · [[law]].
