# cloudflare/seal

Cloudflare config sealing — content-uuid identity, decrypt only on proof.

Extracted from `cloudflare/seal.ts`: a matter file at an atom root is a stray sibling — only `index.ts`, `test.ts` and `seed.ts` live beside a barrel ([[rules]]) — and the lawful form is the child atom it already was, with its own proof beside it.

Composes: [[cloudflare]].
