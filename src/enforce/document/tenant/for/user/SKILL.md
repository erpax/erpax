# enforce/document/tenant/for/user — the create that the plugin's access rules let through

`@payloadcms/plugin-multi-tenant` scopes what a user can *read* and *update*. What it does not
reliably reject is a **create that names another tenant**: the document does not exist yet, so there
is no existing row whose tenant can be checked, and a request body naming someone else's tenant can
walk straight in.

This `beforeChange` hook closes that door. It compares the document's tenant against the tenants the
authenticated user actually belongs to, and refuses otherwise. Super-admins are unrestricted, because
they are the principal the model already trusts across tenants.

The failure it prevents is the worst shape a multi-tenant system has: not an error, but a **200
carrying a row written into another organisation's data**. Nothing alerts, nothing logs, and the
damage is discovered by the other tenant.

**Honest boundary.** This proves a document cannot be *assigned* to a tenant the user does not belong
to. It is not the whole of tenant isolation — read scoping, field-level access and the query filters
each belong elsewhere ([[rules]]/bypass covers the route-level case). It complements the plugin; it
does not replace it.

**Law — [[law]]: a create is the one operation with no prior row to check, so it is checked against
the actor instead. Trusting a request body's tenant field is trusting the caller to say who they are.**

## Standards

- **ISO/IEC 27001 A.5.23** — cloud-service tenant isolation.
- **ISO/IEC 27002 §5.15 · §8.3** — access control; information access restriction.
- **GDPR Art. 5(1)(f)** — integrity and confidentiality.

Composes: `enforce` · `is/super/admin` · [[rules]]/bypass · [[law]].
