# platform/readiness — one survey answers "is this shippable", instead of eighty slices each claiming it

`buildToolCatalog` enumerates the live MCP tool surface and `toolsByArea` groups it;
`buildReadinessManifest` folds that into a single manifest a reader can act on.

The point is that it is COMPUTED from the tools that actually registered. A readiness claim
assembled by hand is a summary of what its author remembered.

Composes: [[law]].
