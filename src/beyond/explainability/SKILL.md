# beyond/explainability — self-explainability (auto-generated narrative)

Law 19 of the [[beyond]] horizon: every business outcome (invoice posted, tax computed, credit declined) ships a generated explanation citing the standards, chain steps and data sources. `autoExplain` composes the text deterministically by simple template substitution — no LLM in this path, so deterministic replay holds — and emits per-locale `text` (EN narrative; non-EN locales get `[en]` stub markers the i18n strict mode catches). `isExplanationComplete` verifies the result is non-trivial: it has locale text and at least one cited standard.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/explainability/index.ts (`autoExplain` · `isExplanationComplete`) — `Explanation` typed in src/beyond/types.

**Law — [[law]]: every outcome carries its own explanation, composed deterministically (no LLM, [[standard]] EU AI Act Art. 13 transparency) so it replays byte-identical — the [[trinity]] proof holds the completeness invariant.**
