name: pqc
description: Use when an audit-chain leaf signature must survive a quantum adversary — post-quantum cryptography, the migration target from SHA-256 to lattice signatures (ML-DSA / SLH-DSA, FIPS 204) so a future Shor-capable machine cannot forge the [[signature]] that seals the [[audit]] chain.

# beyond/pqc — post-quantum signatures (the quantum-proof seal)

A horizon law: today's [[signature]] over an [[audit]] leaf is RSA/ECDSA-flavoured and a large quantum computer would forge it. `pqc` names the migration target — lattice signatures (ML-DSA, FIPS 204) and stateful-hash signatures — and pins which algorithms NIST has approved, so the seal that makes the [[audit]] chain tamper-evident stays unforgeable when [[quantum]] hardware arrives. The signing/verifying matter is a documented STUB until the Workers-friendly liboqs lands; only the approved-algorithm gate is live.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/pqc/index.ts (`signPqc` · `verifyPqc` · `isApprovedPqc`). A [[beyond]]-horizon primitive that hardens the [[integrity]] substrate.

**Law — [[law]]: the [[signature]] that seals the [[audit]] chain must be forgeable by no adversary, classical or quantum — only NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms may sign, so the seal outlives the machine that would break it.**
