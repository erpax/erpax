# beyond/cost — cost accountability per chain step

Law 15 of the [[beyond]] horizon: every chain step records its compute / storage / network price, accrued against a per-tenant budget. `estimateMicroUsd` prices a `CostMetric` from the Cloudflare-Workers rate list (CPU-ms, egress KB, AI tokens). `recordCost` adds the step's cost (the explicit `microUsd` or the estimate) to the tenant's spend and returns `{ ok: false }` the moment spend crosses the cap — a hard refusal, not an overrun. `setBudget` sets the cap; `getBudget` reads spend-and-cap. The money dual of [[carbon]].

Matter-twin: src/beyond/cost/index.ts (`setBudget` · `recordCost` · `estimateMicroUsd` · `getBudget` · `__resetBudgets`) — `CostMetric` typed in src/beyond/types.

**Law — [[law]]: every step has a price; spend is conserved against a tenant cap and the step is refused once the cap is crossed ([[standard]] Cloudflare-Workers price list) — the [[trinity]] proof holds the budget-gate invariant.**
