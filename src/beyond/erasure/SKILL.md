# beyond/erasure — a right-to-erasure request is met by losing the KEY, never the record

Deleting a posted row breaks the ledger it belongs to. Crypto-shredding keeps the record and
destroys the ability to read it: `seal` encrypts, `open` decrypts while the key lives, and
`shred` drops the key from the `KeyVault` so the `SealedRecord` becomes permanently opaque.

The accounting stays balanced and the audit chain stays continuous, because nothing was
removed — only rendered unreadable. That is what makes erasure compatible with an immutable
ledger at all.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the key is gone from the vault; it does not prove no copy of
the plaintext was taken elsewhere before the seal.

Composes: [[law]].
