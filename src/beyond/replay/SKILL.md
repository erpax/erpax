# beyond/replay — deterministic replay (byte-identical re-computation)

Law 12 of the [[beyond]] horizon: given an [[audit]] leaf and a tenant snapshot, the chain step can be re-run and proven to produce the exact same output. `effectsHash` canonicalizes an `AgentEffect` sequence (stripping non-deterministic `emittedAt` timestamps from emit events) into a content-uuid via the [[integrity]] substrate, so the same inputs always hash to the same value. `replayLeaf` invokes the caller's re-run and returns `ok:true` only when the recomputed hash matches the expected one. `isReplayStable` checks a sequence is JCS-serializable and carries no missing timestamps.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/replay/index.ts (`effectsHash` · `replayLeaf` · `isReplayStable`) — `ReplayRequest` / `ReplayResult` typed in src/beyond/types.

**Law — [[law]]: the same inputs always recompute to the same [[integrity]] hash; a replay counts only when the recomputed effects-hash is byte-identical to the [[audit]] leaf's recorded output — the [[trinity]] proof holds the determinism invariant.**
