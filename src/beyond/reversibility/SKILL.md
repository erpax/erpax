# beyond/reversibility — typed inverse of every state transition

Law 20 of the [[beyond]] horizon: every [[agent]] effect that mutated state carries a typed inverse, so the corpus can be wound back without bespoke per-collection code. `inverseOf` maps each `AgentEffect` kind to its `InverseEffect` — `create` needs the created id, `update` needs the previous state, `emit` and `audit` produce undo/tombstone effects, while calls and external side-effects (notify, escalate, capture) that have left the system boundary report `cannot-invert` with a reason. `isFullyReversible` is true only when every effect in a sequence is invertible given its context.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/reversibility/index.ts (`inverseOf` · `isFullyReversible`) — `InverseEffect` typed in src/beyond/types.

**Law — [[law]]: every reversible state transition has exactly one typed inverse, and an effect that has left the system boundary is honestly marked cannot-invert — never silently dropped; the [[trinity]] proof holds the inverse-exhaustiveness invariant.**
