# beyond/bitemporal — bitemporal queries (system-time × valid-time)

Law 14 of the [[beyond]] horizon: every value has two clocks — when the system *recorded* it and when it was *true in the world*. A bitemporal read fixes both coordinates at once. `isHistoricalQuery` is the pure gate (the request's `recordedAt` is in the past ⇒ a valid look-back); `asOf` is the temporal-table read, a deliberate STUB until a temporal-table extension lands, refusing with `{ ok: false, reason }` rather than guessing.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/bitemporal/index.ts (`asOf` · `isHistoricalQuery`) — coordinates typed in src/beyond/types.

**Law — [[law]]: a value carries two clocks ([[standard]] SQL:2011 system-time × valid-time); a query that does not fix both is incomplete, and the temporal read refuses rather than fabricates — the [[trinity]] proof holds the refusal contract.**
