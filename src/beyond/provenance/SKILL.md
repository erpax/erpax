# beyond/provenance — causal provenance (the WHY behind every value)

The [[audit]] chain records WHAT changed; `provenance` records WHY — which upstream leaves CAUSED this one. Every value carries a PROV-style causal chain of directed `causedBy` edges, so a regulator can ask not just "when did this change" but "what produced it", and the answer is a recoverable ancestry walked backwards from the leaf. It is the [[cause]] relation made auditable: the causal graph over the [[audit]] leaves, content-addressed through the [[integrity]] uuid.

Matter-twin: src/beyond/provenance/index.ts (`recordCausalLink` · `getCausalAncestry` · `getProvenance` · `provenanceUuid`). A [[beyond]]-horizon primitive layered over the [[audit]] substrate.

**Law — [[law]]: every value's history of [[cause]] is recoverable, not only its history of change — each [[audit]] leaf records which upstream leaves produced it, so the full causal ancestry walks back with no break.**
