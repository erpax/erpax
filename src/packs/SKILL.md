# packs — the dispatch carton

One pack is one carton of dispatch, packed from a production [[lots|lot]] — the end of the manufacturing flow ([[work/orders]] → [[lots]] → pack → ship). Evolved from 118,716 rows of the 20-year etrima `packs` ledger; the model below is the **data-true** encoding, the Rails accidents dropped.

**Lifecycle is DERIVED, never stored.** AUDIT: `status` was NULL in 100% of rows — the carton's state lived in its unit and weight watermarks. `derivePackState` (afterRead) reads the seven-position [[horo]] ring `open · packing · packed · weighed · shipped · delivered · closed` from packing progress + the seal timestamps. The ring is harmony-checked at build time (off-ring throws).

**Mass balance — the carton's double-entry of weight.** `grossWeight = netWeight + tareWeight` ([[balance]]): when net and tare are both given the gross is derived as their sum, so the three masses can never drift; a standalone weigh-bridge gross stands alone. AUDIT: weight populated on ~42% of rows (weighed when weighed). Units roll up from the lines: `unitsPacked = Σ` [[pack/items]]`.unitsPacked` (>0 on 99.99% of rows).

**The cross.** `lot` → [[lots]] is a real relationship (AUDIT: 0.02% null — effectively required). The not-yet-minted dispatch siblings (pallet, packaging, packing-list, client) are content-addressed CODES so the leaf stays merge-safe ([[coordinate]]) — they wire to real relationships once those collections land. DEAD columns dropped: `order_id` (100% null), `tracking_number` (0% populated).

Matter-twin: `src/packs/index.ts`. Composes [[lots]] · [[pack/items]] · [[horo]] · [[balance]] · [[coordinate]] · [[accounting]].
