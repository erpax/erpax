# invoices/invoice/lines/hooks — a total is recomputed from the lines, never accepted from the caller

`recomputeInvoiceTotals` derives the header's amounts from the lines whenever a line changes, and
`recomputeItemInventory` moves the stock the line commits. `beforeValidate` normalises the line
before either runs.

A total sent by a client is a number that can disagree with the rows beneath it. Recomputing it
means the invoice cannot state a sum its own lines do not make.

Composes: [[law]].
