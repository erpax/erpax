# categories/hooks — the category collection-module boundary

The collection-level [[hooks]] barrel for Categories. One path-segment shallow so collection wiring imports `categoriesBeforeChange` (the ordered beforeChange chain) without reaching into each sibling. The only law it enforces today is tenant-pinning — `enforceDocumentTenantForUser` attaches/creates each category inside the caller's active tenant, so isolation is decided at the write boundary, not downstream.

Matter-twin: `src/categories/hooks/index.ts` (barrel re-exporting `categoriesBeforeChange` from `./beforeChange`). Composes [[hooks]].

**Law — [[law]]: the Categories beforeChange chain is one ordered barrel — every row is tenant-pinned at the collection boundary before it is written (multi-tenant isolation is decided on the write path, not after).**
