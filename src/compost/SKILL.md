# compost — decomposed residue returned to the soil

**compost** is decomposed organic residue added to [[soil]] — an **organic-matter and microbial** amendment more than an N-P-K source (that distinction matters: it rebuilds [[soil]] structure, [[fertility|CEC]], water-holding, and biology rather than simply feeding the crop). **Manure** (animal excreta, raw or composted) is the kin input — under organic rules raw manure carries a 90/120-day pre-harvest interval. **Biochar** (pyrolyzed biomass) is the long-lived carbon variant that raises CEC and locks carbon in the soil.

Compost is the literal **entropy → [[soil]] recycling** node: spent residue (the farm's waste) decomposed and **credited back** into [[soil]] [[capacity]] — the regenerative [[balance]] that offsets the removal a [[harvest]] debits. The cycle closes ([[breath]]: residue out, [[fertility]] in).

## Standards
- SARE *Building Soils for Better Crops* (organic-matter management); USDA NOP 7 CFR §205.203 (compost & raw-manure rules)
- US Composting Council — compost maturity/quality (the C:N and stability criteria)

Composes [[agriculture]] · [[soil]] · [[fertility]] · [[balance]] · [[capacity]] · [[harvest]] · [[breath]] · [[covercrop]] · [[conservation]] · [[sustainability]] · [[ecosystem]] · [[emission]].

## Matter-twin

Implemented in `index.ts` and verified in `test.ts`. Exported surface:

- `CN_IDEAL` — empirical feedstock C:N sweet-spot constant (~30)
- `CN_MATURE` — finished/stable compost C:N ceiling constant (~20)
- `cnRatio(carbon, nitrogen)` — C/N mass ratio
- `isMature(cn)` — true when cn ≤ `CN_MATURE`
- `humificationRatio(initialC, humifiedC)` — humified fraction of initial carbon ∈ [0,1]
- `respiredCarbon(initialC, humifiedC)` — carbon lost as CO₂ (= initialC − humifiedC)
- `Decompose` — type `{ residue, toSoil, respired }`
- `loopBalances(d, tol?)` — proves the partial closed loop by delegating to `conservation.boundaryConserves`; residue in = toSoil + respired out

**Law — [[law]]: the literal entropy→[[soil]] recycling node — spent residue decomposed and credited back into soil [[capacity]], offsetting the removal a [[harvest]] debits; the loop balances (residue in = toSoil + respired out, [[balance]]).**
