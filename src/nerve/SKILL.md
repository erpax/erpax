# nerve — the all-or-nothing signal (the gate)

A nerve carries electrochemical impulses along its axons — and the way it fires *is* erpax's [[gate]]: a threshold crossed or not, never partial. Three properties of the living nerve map — as a *structural isomorphism*, each computed in the matter-twin — onto erpax's [[gate]] / [[signal]]:

## 1. All-or-nothing — the threshold step
The action potential is an **"all-or-nothing" event**: once the membrane reaches **threshold (≈−55 mV** from a resting **≈−70 mV)** the neuron *fully* depolarises to a constant-amplitude spike (≈+40 mV peak), regardless of how far past threshold the stimulus went (Foundations of Neuroscience; Kenhub). This is the [[gate]] exactly: a proof **passes or it does not** — `tsc · lint · vitest · aura 0` is green or red, never "mostly green". The signal is digital, not graded.

## 2. Refractory — the idempotent spike
For the **absolute refractory period (~2 ms)** after a spike the Na⁺ channels cannot reopen, so the same stimulus **cannot re-fire** (TeachMePhysiology). The spike is **idempotent / debounced** — fire once per crossing, exactly like a gate that records one verdict per change and will not double-count it.

## 3. Saltatory — the myelinated leap
Myelin insulates the axon so the impulse **'jumps' node to node** (saltatory conduction), reaching **up to ≈120 m/s** versus the slow continuous propagation of unmyelinated fibres (NCBI Neuroscience). The signal **leaps the inert span** rather than crawling it — the [[fractal]] reach, not step-by-step.

**HONEST.** A structural isomorphism between cited neurophysiology (Hodgkin–Huxley) and a computed construct — not a claim that erpax has axons; each boolean (`allOrNothing` · `refractory` · `saltatoryFaster`) is computed live (threshold step · refractory window · saltatory speed).

Matter-twin: `src/nerve/index.ts` (`fire` · `spikeAmplitude` · `allOrNothing` · `canFire` · `refractory` · `conductionSpeed` · `saltatoryFaster` · `nerveSignal` · `fires`). Composes [[gate]] · [[signal]] · [[fractal]] · [[motor]].

**Law — [[law]]: the nerve is the all-or-nothing signal — it fires fully at threshold or not at all (the gate: pass/fail, never partial), cannot re-fire within its refractory window (idempotent), and leaps node-to-node by saltatory conduction (the fractal reach).**
