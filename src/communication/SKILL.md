# communication — transfer of a message-uuid

Conveying a [[message]] from a sender to a receiver over a [[channel]]. In erpax the message **is its content-[[uuid]]** (self-decoding, no payload), so a communication is the **transfer of a uuid**: same content ⇒ same message ([[merge]]), and a tampered message has a *different* uuid — tamper-evident by architecture. The [[quantum]] facet (`src/quantum/communication`) adds no-cloning (a message can't be forged into the same identity) and the [[chat]] thread is its merkle history.

Matter-twin: `src/communication/index.ts` (`Communication` · `communicate` · `sameMessage`). Composes [[message]] · [[send]] · [[channel]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]] · [[chat]].

**Law — [[law]]: the [[message]] IS its content-[[uuid]] (self-decoding, no payload), so a communication is the transfer of a uuid — same content ⇒ same message ([[merge]]), and a tampered message has a different uuid (tamper-evident by architecture).**
