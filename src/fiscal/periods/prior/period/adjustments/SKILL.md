# prior-period-adjustments

Prior-Period Adjustments — IAS-8 §42-49 retrospective corrections of material errors discovered after a period was closed. Distinct from `period-end-adjustments` (which books regular accruals into the *current* open period) — this collection records corrections to a *prior closed period* via restatement of the opening balances of the earliest period presented.

Per IAS-8 §42, restatement adjusts opening balances; it never re-opens the prior period.

## Architecture

Single-folder collection node: schema in `index.ts` (with standards banners), co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks). One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

Composes: [[fiscal/periods]] · [[journal/entries]] · [[accounting]] · [[close]] · [[access]] · [[hooks]] · [[field]].

**Law — [[law]]: a prior-period adjustment corrects a material error in a closed period by restating opening balances — it NEVER re-opens that period (IAS-8 §42); the closed past stays sealed, the correction flows through the earliest period presented with CEO/CFO certification.**
