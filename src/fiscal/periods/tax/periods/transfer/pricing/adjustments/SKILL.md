# transfer-pricing-adjustments

TransferPricingAdjustments Collection.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: a transfer-pricing adjustment restates an intercompany amount to arm's-length under one declared OECD method (CUP/cost-plus/resale/profit-split/TNMM), backed by contemporaneous documentation and advanced documented → validated → approved → posted; it cannot post without that method and evidence.**
