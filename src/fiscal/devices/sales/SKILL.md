СУПТО Sales (продажби) — the Наредба Н-18 sale register.

This is the single-folder collection node: `index.ts` (schema + standards banners),
co-located `seed.ts` (opening data) and `index.test.ts` (invariant checks) live here.
One folder per collection ⇒ no scatter ⇒ no drift.

**Law — [[law]]: every sale receives an immutable, gapless УНП and is frozen on close — there is no delete; a mistake is corrected only by a сторно reversal, and the content-uuid hash makes the closed sale tamper-proof (Наредба Н-18 СУПТО).**
