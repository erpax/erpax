# direction — a course change that lands on the same tick

A worker that only notices new instructions when it next resumes is not being directed, it is being queued. This atom collapses that gap: a coordinator publishes a **sealed** direction on a path, and every subscriber on that path observes it synchronously — no resume-wait. In-flight work carries an `InterruptToken`, and a publish bumps the generation so stale tokens are invalid rather than merely old.

The seal matters as much as the speed. A direction is content-addressed, so a worker can tell that what it received is what was sent, and two workers on the same path agree without comparing notes.

## Why it is `direction`, not `direction-bus`

Every export names the payload, not the pipe — `DirectionPayload`, `SealedDirection`, `publishDirection`, `subscribeDirection`, `interruptTokenFor`. The bus is the mechanism; **direction** is the concept, and a path states concepts ([[rules]]/invisible: the path is the message).

Nesting it as `direction/bus` would have been the literal reading of the hyphen and the wrong one — it would leave `direction/` an orphan parent with no trinity of its own, inventing a level to hold a word rather than to hold meaning.

## What the move cost

Twelve importers across `apply`, `monitor`, `agent/communication` and `quantum`, all repointed in the same diff ([[rules]]/reference: a moved file carries its references). Two `@see` docstrings pointed at the old name and were carried too — a stale pointer in prose is the defect that gate exists for.

One thing bit, and it is worth recording. A blanket rewrite of `./direction-bus` → `./direction` also rewrote the import **inside the moved test**, where the correct target was `./index` — from within `direction/`, `./direction` addresses a child that does not exist. **`tsc` reported zero errors**; only running the suite found it. That is the same shape as [[quantum]]/ftl/admin's self-import and [[quantum]]/dimension's missed `.tsx` consumers: the compiler is not a reference checker, and a move is verified by execution or not at all.

**Honest boundary.** This proves a published direction is **sealed and observed on the same tick by subscribers on that path** — not that a worker *obeys* it, and not that it reaches a worker in another process. Delivery beyond the in-process bus is the transport's problem; whether the direction was wise is nobody's but the author's.

**Law — [[law]]: a hyphen names the mechanism where the path should name the concept. Fold it to what the matter IS — and verify a move by running it, because the compiler will not tell you that a relative specifier changed meaning.**
