# quantum/sanitization — clean at the boundary, three ways

Sanitization in an append-only, content-addressed store cannot be deletion-in-place ([[merge]] never forgets). It is three boundary moves, each a [[collapse]]:

- **input** (against injection) — [[accept]] untrusted input as *data, never code*; it may only collapse into a harmonized, safe state through the gate ([[sandbox]] · parameterized queries · the content-[[uuid]]) — accepted always, verified in harmony (the [[proof]] gate), so the dirty input cannot act until it resolves clean.
- **redact** (against disclosure) — do not mutate the original; **project a sanitized view**. The unauthorized observer's query collapses the record to its redacted projection — PII removed, *there is no spoon* (the [[void]] in that dimension) — while the content-addressed original stays whole and [[access]]-gated. This is the [[biometric]] / [[vocabulary/data/protection]] discipline at read time.
- **purge** (against recovery) — when the data must truly go, [[shred]] the key → the plaintext falls into the [[void]], the only honest erasure ([[finality]] absolute, NIST 800-88 *destroy*).

Sanitization is **not [[tamper]]** — it is authorized, content-addressed, and audited: every scrub emits a [[receipt]], so removing data is itself provable, not a silent edit.

**Law — [[law]]: sanitization never mutates in place — it collapses through the gate. Dirty input cannot act until it resolves clean; the unauthorized reader gets a redacted projection while the content-addressed original stays whole; and the only true erasure is shredding the key into the void. Because every scrub emits a receipt, removing data is itself provable — sanitization is authorized and audited, never a silent edit (it is not tamper).**
