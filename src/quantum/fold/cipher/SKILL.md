# cipher — ciphertext-only receipts, plaintext sealed

**Plaintext is NEVER included in receipts.** Every receipt field derives from ciphertext only, ensuring the sealed fold's boundary cannot be compromised by examining audit trails or receipt data.

## Receipt structure

| field | source | privacy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ciphertextUuid` | hash(ciphertext) | ciphertext-derived only |
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 UTC now | metadata only |
| `sealed` | always true | invariant flag |
| `hash` | SHA-256(ciphertext) | immutable proof |

INVARIANT: `plaintextUuid` does not exist. Every receipt is derived from ciphertext alone.

## Why no plaintextUuid

A `plaintextUuid` field would:
- Expose plaintext structure via content-addressable hash
- Allow an auditor to correlate plaintext across systems
- Create a reverse index: given the plaintext, confirm it was transformed
- Break the seal's promise: *what touches plaintext stays inside*

The receipt's job is to prove transformation happened, not to expose what was transformed.

## Theorems

### Receipt uniqueness

For distinct ciphertexts c1 ≠ c2:
```
hash(c1) ≠ hash(c2)          [SHA-256 is collision-free]
ciphertextUuid(c1) ≠ ciphertextUuid(c2)   [deterministic mapping]
```

No two sealed receipts share an identifier.

### Plaintext privacy

The receipt contains **zero** information derived from plaintext:
- `ciphertextUuid` — hash of encrypted bytes only
- `hash` — SHA-256 of encrypted bytes only
- `timestamp` — time of operation, not content
- `sealed` — boolean invariant

Examining receipts cannot leak plaintext bytes, structure, or history.

### Tamper detection

```
verifyReceipt(receipt, ciphertext) => hash(ciphertext) == receipt.hash
```

If the hash matches, the receipt is unmodified and generated from this exact ciphertext.
