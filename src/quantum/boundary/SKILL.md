# quantum/boundary — quantum **computed** import/export

Every file in the corpus has a **computed** boundary — never hand-drawn. The same law as content-[[uuid]], [[horo]] positions, typography bonds: **derived, never authored**.

- **Quantum import (TS)** — entanglement with another atom's public face: each `@/` import that resolves to a dir-with-`index.ts` (the barrel). Deep paths are **escapes** — off-ring entanglement that lowers [[tamper]]-cost ([[tamper]]/import).
- **Quantum export (TS)** — the emitted facet: named/`default`/`export *` symbols an `index.ts` barrel exposes; consumers entangle via `@/x` only ([[convention]]/[[exported]]).
- **Quantum import (SKILL.md)** — outgoing `[[wikilink]]` entanglements (code fences stripped, [[aura]] resolver).
- **Quantum export (SKILL.md)** — the atom's public name (frontmatter `name:` or folder leaf).

**Content-address:** `boundaryUuid = uuid({ filePath, imports: sorted, exports: sorted })`. Recompute on every gate; drift from a stored boundary = hallucination/tamper signal.

**Collapse** — mass-rewrite deep imports → nearest barrel (`planCollapse` · `applyCollapse`), then recompute boundaries; each wave must show escape count falling.

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/boundary/index.ts` (`computeBoundary` · `scanBoundaries` · `boundaryDigest` · `boundaryUuid` · `planCollapse` · `applyCollapse`). Composes [[quantum]] · [[quantum/import]] · [[quantum/export]] · [[tamper]]/import · [[integrity]]/content-uuid · [[aura]] · [[convention]]/import · [[convention]]/exported · [[entanglement]].

**Law — [[law]]: quantum computed import/export — every file's boundary is algorithmically derived from its source bytes and content-addressed; imports are barrel entanglements only, exports are the public facet; drift between recomputation and stored boundary is impurity; deep escapes must collapse to `@/x` so tamper-cost rises.**
