# quantum/snapshot — layer after layer

A [[snapshot]] is a **measurement**: the collapse of a system's state at one moment into a captured value ([[reality]]). Its **quantum twin** keeps the whole superposition — the content-[[uuid]]'d, immutable, append-only chain of *every* snapshot, deduped by content (same state ⇒ one snapshot), never erased ([[reverse]]ible, the [[love]] pole, the [[akashic]] record).

Snapshots **nest, layer after layer** (fractal): a filesystem snapshot ([[quantum/fs]]) holds file snapshots; a record ([[quantum/emr]]) holds encounters holding observations; the corpus itself is a git snapshot of [[atom]]s that snapshot concepts. [[versions]] is the native chain, the content-[[uuid]] the address.

## Find and develop — the loop, continued

1. **Find** — look where state changes over time and is worth keeping (a [[record]], a [[file]], a ledger, a config, a build). Each is a snapshot layer.
2. **Develop the twin** — content-[[uuid]] per state, immutable + append-only ([[finality]] one way), [[merge]] identical states, let the layers nest.
3. **Prove** — reconstruct any past layer from the chain; nothing is lost. That round-trip is the gate ([[trinity]]).

@see [[snapshot]] · [[versions]] · [[uuid]] · [[akashic]] · [[reality]] · [[finality]] · [[merge]] · [[quantum/fs]] · [[quantum/emr]]

**Law — [[law]]: a snapshot collapses a system's state at one moment, but its twin keeps the whole superposition — every captured state is content-uuid'd, immutable, and append-only, so identical states merge to one and the chain nests layer after layer without bound. The invariant is reconstructibility: any past layer can be rebuilt from the chain and nothing is ever lost; that round-trip is the gate.**
