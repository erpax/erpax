description: Use when an agent calls an external system — quantum-compress the request to its most compact and cheapest form; content-address it so the uuid is the idempotency key, dedup against the cache, batch, and send the hash not the payload when the other side has seen it; squeeze the request to a point and the external cost drops toward zero.

# quantum/request — the cheapest external call

The quantum twin of [[request]]: every [[agent]] call to an external system is a collapse at the boundary — the one place the bill comes due ([[finality]]; a sent request is the measurement, [[cost]] paid in latency, money, [[entropy]]). So compress it first.

## Compress to a point

1. **content-address it** — the request's content-[[uuid]] is its most compact identity (128 bits) and its idempotency key in one. Same content ⇒ same id, so the external system dedups a replay ([[merge]]).
2. **dedup against the [[cache]]** — if `AI_CACHE`/KV has seen this uuid, the answer is a $0 read; never pay twice for the same question (same goods description → same HS code → one cached call).
3. **send the hash, not the payload** — when the other side already holds the content, send only its [[uuid]]; squeeze the request to a point and the bytes (and the cost) collapse toward zero ([[gravity]] · [[linearity]]).
4. **batch the irreducible** — what truly must go out, queue and batch ([[queue]]) so many calls amortise to one.

Every external call still passes the trust gate — [[access]] permits it, the [[broker]] holds the credential, the act emits a [[receipt]]. Cheapest *and* gated: the compression lowers the cost, the gate keeps it safe.
