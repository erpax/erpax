# quantum/marine — the law of the sea, encoded in math

The sea has no fences, so its law is **geometry**: where you are determines who governs you. UNCLOS (1982) fixes the zones as exact distances from the baseline, which makes jurisdiction computable from a position — *position → zone → sovereign*:

- **≤ 12 nm — territorial sea** (Art. 3): coastal-state sovereignty, subject to innocent passage.
- **≤ 24 nm — contiguous zone** (Art. 33): limited enforcement (customs, immigration, sanitary).
- **≤ 200 nm — EEZ** (Art. 57): coastal-state sovereign rights over resources; high-seas freedoms otherwise remain.
- **> 200 nm — high seas** (Art. 86): no sovereignty. Only the **flag state** governs (Art. 92) — and a [[vessel]]'s flag is its registry, its [[identity]], a content-[[uuid]]. On the open sea, *you are the law you are registered under*.

## General average — the sea's double-entry

When part of the venture is sacrificed to save the whole — [[cargo]] jettisoned, a [[ship]] deliberately grounded — the loss is borne not by the unlucky owner but by **all interests in proportion to the value each had at risk** (the York-Antwerp principle). That is exactly [[accounting]]: the saved are debited, the sacrificer credited, and the contributions sum to the loss — the books [[balance]], even at sea. `generalAverage` computes it; conservation is the test.

## Honest

The zone thresholds and article numbers are **treaty facts** (nautical miles under UNCLOS); general average is stated as its proportional **principle**, in plain words, not reproduced from any rule text. This models the *structure* of the law so it is checkable — it is educational, **not legal advice**.

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/marine/index.ts` (`zoneOf` · `jurisdiction` · `generalAverage` · `NM_TERRITORIAL` · `NM_CONTIGUOUS` · `NM_EEZ`). Composes [[vessel]] · [[ship]] · [[cargo]] · [[sea]] · [[identity]] · [[uuid]] · [[accounting]] · [[balance]] · [[quantum]] · [[law]].

**Law — [[law]]: the sea is governed by geometry — distance from the baseline fixes the zone, the zone fixes the sovereign; beyond every zone, only the flag (the vessel's identity) governs. A sacrifice for the common voyage is shared by all in proportion, and the books balance even at sea.**
