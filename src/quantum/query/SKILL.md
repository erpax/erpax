# quantum/query — a query as a content-uuid

The quantum facet of [[query]]: a normalized query string hashes to a content-[[uuid]], so the same query (whitespace/case folded) shares **one identity** — a cache key / [[merge]] — and any change yields a new uuid (cache invalidation by content-address). The generic counterpart of [[quantum]]/sql. Merges into [[query]].

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/query/index.ts` (`queryUuid` · `sameQuery`). Composes [[query]] · [[quantum]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: two queries share one identity iff their normalized text (trimmed and lower-cased) is equal — normalization defines the equivalence, so a lookup hits the same cache key under any whitespace or case variation, and any meaningful change yields a new uuid that invalidates by content-address.**
