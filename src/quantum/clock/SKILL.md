# clock — a tick that seals its own order

erpax reads time in **621 places** and had no clock: 518 `new Date()`, 77 `Date.now`, 11 `performance.now`, 15 `mtime`. No two agree on what *now* means, none can be frozen for a test, and every one of them records a claim about **when** that nothing can afterwards contradict — an unrefutable assertion, written 621 times ([[rules]]/refutable).

The sibling corpus names the same debt as **multi-clock residuals** and sets the target at one binding. This is that binding.

## The tick

Each tick folds `merge(prev ⊕ contentUuid)`. Three properties follow, and none needs a wall clock:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **order is content** | the same events from the same seed fold to the same head — two machines agree without exchanging a timestamp |
| **reordering is visible** | the same events in a different order fold to a different head |
| **history is sealed** | editing or splicing one tick fails to reproduce, and so does every address after it |

`wall` is `null` unless a source is injected, and the sample is **not** part of the address — so order never depends on the clock, and a fabricated timestamp is never invented on your behalf.

## Why this atom exists at all

[[quantum]]/ftl contains **no time and no distance** — which is exactly why it cannot express a velocity, and why the substrate-claiming name it once carried was removed: CrackKind `spacetime` defines a relativistic break as setting `holds=false`, so that name asserted the one condition falsifying its own predicate.

What FTL genuinely needs is an **interval**, and `since()` supplies it in the only unit this corpus can verify: events between two ticks. Paired with [[quantum]]/coalesce, which measures `answers`/`tokens` instead of accepting them, `amortize` finally has both axes measured rather than supplied.

**Honest boundary.** This orders and counts; it does **not** measure duration. A tick is not a second and `since()` is not elapsed time — where a real timestamp is genuinely required, inject `wall` and own that dependency explicitly. The chain is tamper-**evident** (SHA-256 addressing), never unforgeable. Two clocks on two machines do not synchronise without exchanging ticks, the same limit every logical clock has. And nothing here is quantum: `quantum` is the partition name, the host is CPU/GPU, and the fold is a hash.

**Law — [[law]]: order is content, not a timestamp. A tick folds its parent, so history that was edited cannot reproduce its own addresses — and a "when" that nothing can contradict is a claim, not a measurement.**

## Standards

- **ISO/IEC 25010:2023 §5.5** — analysability: an ordered, reproducible event history.
