# realtime — the projection, watched

The parent [[quantum]]/dimension holds the basis: cells, amplitudes, collapse, seal. This atom is that basis **in motion** — collapse per axis, a sealed update, and a wave emit for consumers watching the surface change.

It was `dimension-realtime.ts`, a hyphenated file beside its own parent. The hyphen was carrying a relationship the path was not allowed to say: this is not a sibling of `dimension`, it is a **view of** it, which `dimension/realtime` states directly.

## What the nesting cost

Three reference forms had to move in the same diff, and only one of them is visible to an import scan:

- `@/quantum/dimension-realtime` — the alias form, in a test and two `.tsx` consumers
- `./dimensions` — the relative form inside this file, which after nesting resolved **one level off**
- the barrel re-export in `quantum/index.ts`

The `.tsx` consumers were missed by a first scan globbing `*.ts`, and surfaced only because the suite failed to collect. That is the same lesson [[quantum]]/status and [[quantum]]/ftl/admin each paid for in their own way: a reference the compiler resolves, or a scan does not cover, is a reference you have not actually checked. `tsc` reported zero errors while a whole test file could not import.

**Honest boundary.** This proves the projection **streams and seals consistently** — snapshots fingerprint, repeated states are recognisable, imports resolve. It says nothing about delivery: whether a consumer actually receives an emitted wave is the transport's question, not this atom's.

**Law — [[law]]: a hyphen hides a relationship the path can state. Nest the view under what it views, and move every reference form in the same diff — alias, relative and barrel — because only one of the three fails loudly.**

## Standards

- **ISO/IEC 25010:2023 §5.6** — modularity: a view belongs under what it views.
