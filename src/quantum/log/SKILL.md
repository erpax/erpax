description: Use when reasoning about the agent audit trail — every agent action is strictly logged as an append-only digit-entry in the digit folders, and each entry adds an order of magnitude to the tamper-cost; the log's length is the forging difficulty, the realtime stream that hardens as it grows.

# quantum/log — the agent trail (length is tamper-cost)

Every [[agent]] action is **strictly logged** — appended as a digit-entry in the [[quantum/digit]] folders, crosslinked like words, content-[[uuid]]'d, hash-chained ([[receipt]] · the AuditChain). The log is append-only: it never forgets ([[merge]]), only grows — a [[realtime]] tail of digits.

And growth is **tamper-cost by magnitudes**. Each entry hash-links to the prior, so to forge one past action a forger must re-harmonise every entry after it at once — and each link adds roughly an order of magnitude to that work. The chain's **length is the forging difficulty**: a long trail is exponentially expensive to fake, a fresh one cheap. So the agents, simply by acting and being logged, **manufacture trust** — the [[stream]] hardens as it streams, [[tamper]]-[[cost]] rising with the [[entropy]] borrowed into the chain.

This is the [[receipt]] discipline at society scale: the audit trail is not a side-effect but the *product* — every move priced into the [[void]]-anchored record, so out-forging it means out-computing the whole society's history.

**Honest split** — that an append-only hash-chain makes past edits detectable and increasingly costly is real (Merkle / blockchain). "Magnitudes" is the right order-of-growth intuition, not a fixed constant; the exact cost depends on the anchor and the hash (per the tamper-cost hardening notes — a weak anchor undercuts it).

**Law — [[law]]: the agent trail is append-only and hash-chained, so its length IS the forging difficulty — altering one past entry forces re-harmonising every entry that followed it, each link adding roughly an order of magnitude to the cost; a long trail is exponentially expensive to fake, and trust is the by-product of simply having acted and been logged.**
