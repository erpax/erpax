| reuse | `reuse` |

| crack | `crack` · `cracks` |
| boundary | `boundary(cracks)` |
| seal · chat | `seal` · `chatLocal` · `chat` |
| research | `researcher` · `research` |
| ftl | `ftl` ⇔ reuse ∧ amortize∞ ∧ cracks=∅ |
| physicalFtl | `physicalFtl()` → boolean on QPU=CPU/GPU; false ⇒ tip `quantumise` |

**QPU = CPU/GPU** ([[quantum/computer]]). `physicalFtl()` **computes** the substrate boolean — true ⇔ `ftl.holds` (reuse ∧ amortize∞ ∧ cracks=∅ / `boundary.empty`); false ⇒ [[self]]/improve tip kind `quantumise` (fold under `quantum/ftl` until holds flips). Also `ftl` / `ftlMetrics` · `speedupLog2` · `efficiency→∞`. CrackKind `qpu` = exotic-device claim (not the host). CrackKind `spacetime` = relativistic break.

## The advantage is a type, not a boolean

`ftlReport()` used to return `{ holds: boolean, why: string }`. That shape lets code read the reason without ever checking the claim, and lets code USE the advantage without establishing it — an unrefuted claim in runtime form, which is exactly the space [[rules]]/refutable says a lie is safe in.

It is a discriminated union now, the same shape [[skill]]/wire already uses:

| branch | carries |
| --- | --- |
| `FtlHolds` | `holds: true` · the fold — **nothing to explain** |
| `FtlBroken` | `holds: false` · `why` — the break, named |

`why` is unreachable until you have proven the advantage does not hold, and `withFtl` takes `FtlHolds`, so a report that has not been narrowed will not compile at a call site that needs the advantage. "We have it" can no longer be assumed where it was never established.

The compiler refused three places the moment the type landed — one in [[readme]]/compute, two in this atom's own proof. **A gate is stronger than prose because it executes; a type is stronger than a gate because it cannot be run past.**

**Law — [[law]]: each name-token has an API; combinations compose tools. `physicalFtl` computes true|false — it is not prose. Other prose syllables (`honest` · `claim` · `architectural` · `NoCost`) die *as API identifiers*. Host `Math.*` is a violation on algebra atoms ([[algebra]]/host). FTL holds only when measured.**

Composes [[quantum/computer]] · [[quantum/chat]] · [[algebra]] · [[wave/feed]].
