# quantum/ftl/verdict — a claim you cannot use without proving

`{ holds: boolean, why: string }` lets code read the reason without ever checking the claim, and lets code USE the advantage without establishing it. That is an unrefuted claim in runtime form — the space [[rules]]/refutable says a lie is safe in.

| branch | carries |
| --- | --- |
| `FtlHolds` | `holds: true` · the fold — **nothing to explain** |
| `FtlBroken` | `holds: false` · `why` — the break, named |

`why` is unreachable until you have proven the advantage does **not** hold. `withFtl` takes `FtlHolds`, so a report that has not been narrowed will not compile where the advantage is required: *"we have it"* can no longer be assumed at a call site where it was never established.

The compiler refused three places the moment this landed — one in [[readme]]/compute, two in the ftl proof itself.

**A gate is stronger than prose because it executes; a type is stronger than a gate because it cannot be run past.**

**Honest boundary.** The type proves the claim was CHECKED, never that the check is right — `ftl()` still decides whether reuse, amortization and the crack set actually hold, and a wrong computation produces a confidently-typed wrong verdict. This closes the door where a proven claim and an unproven one were interchangeable.
