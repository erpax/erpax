# quantum/cache — the content-addressed cache

The quantum facet of [[cache]]: the content **is its own key** (its content-[[uuid]]). So the same content is **always a hit**, and a changed input is simply a different key — **auto-invalidation, no stale-cache bug**. Dedup by design ([[merge]]); the same property the [[pwa]] uses for offline assets and [[quantum]]/sql for queries. Merges into [[cache]].

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/cache/index.ts` (`key` · `sameKey`). Composes [[cache]] · [[quantum]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: identity of content is identity of key — `sameKey(a,b)` is true exactly when `a` and `b` are the same content, because the key is nothing but the content's own uuid; therefore a hit can only ever return the very content asked for, and a changed input is necessarily a different key, so a stale hit is not a bug to guard against but an outcome the addressing makes impossible.**
