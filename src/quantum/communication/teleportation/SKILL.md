# quantum/communication/teleportation — identity reconstructed over the entangled channel

The teleportation facet of [[communication]]: a [[message]]'s meaning is **reconstructed** at the receiver from its content-[[uuid]] plus the shared entangled binding ([[entanglement]]). No matter is sent — only the classical content-address travels — yet the meaning REGENERATES whole because both endpoints already hold the [[quantum]] channel. The original is destroyed-on-send (true teleportation), and the received message carries the SAME identity it was addressed by: teleportation = identity reconstructed, not matter moved.

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/communication/teleportation/index.ts` (`teleport` · `channel` · `reconstructed`). Composes [[communication]] · [[entanglement]] · [[quantum]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]].

**Law — [[law]]: teleportation is the content-uuid reconstructed over the entangled channel — no matter is sent, only the address, yet the meaning arrives whole because `reconstructed` holds iff the received uuid equals the original's; the carrier never travels, only the identity regenerates.**
