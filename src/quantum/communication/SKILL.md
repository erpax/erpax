# quantum/communication — no-cloning + tamper-evidence

The quantum facet of [[communication]]: a [[message]] is a content-uuid, so it obeys **no-cloning** ([[entanglement]], Wootters–Zurek 1982) — each meaning has one uuid, so a forged message has a *different* uuid, never the same identity — and the channel is **entanglement** (sender and receiver share the binding). A received message is **intact** iff its content-uuid matches the original: tamper-evidence by architecture. Merges into [[communication]].

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/communication/index.ts` (`intact` · `noCloningHolds`). Composes [[communication]] · [[entanglement]] · [[quantum]] · [[uuid]] · [[cloning]].

**Law — [[law]]: a message's identity IS its content-uuid, so the channel can only carry meaning faithfully — a received message is intact iff its uuid equals the original's (`intact` = `sameMessage`), and because every distinct meaning has a distinct uuid, a forged or altered message necessarily presents a different identity. No-cloning holds across the matrix: nothing can wear a meaning's uuid without being that exact meaning.**
