# quantum/communication/key — the shared secret IS the symmetric entangled binding

The key-distribution facet of [[communication]]: two peers derive a SHARED SECRET from their entangled binding ([[entanglement]]) — the symmetric, order-independent collision, so both sides compute the SAME key without ever exchanging it. Eavesdropping is DETECTABLE because [[cloning]] is forbidden ([[quantum]] no-cloning, Wootters–Zurek): an intercept-resend cannot reproduce the original's content-[[uuid]], so the relayed carrier presents a different identity and the [[tamper]] is caught.

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/communication/key/index.ts` (`sharedKey` · `eavesdropDetected`). Composes [[communication]] · [[entanglement]] · [[quantum]] · [[uuid]] · [[cloning]] · [[merge]] · [[tamper]].

**Law — [[law]]: the shared secret IS the symmetric entangled binding (`sharedKey(a,b) === sharedKey(b,a)`), so it is computed on both ends without ever travelling; interception necessarily alters the content-uuid, so `eavesdropDetected` fires whenever the relayed identity differs — no-cloning makes the clone attempt detectable.**
