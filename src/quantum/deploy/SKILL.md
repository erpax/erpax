# quantum/deploy — the collapse into reality

The quantum twin of [[deploy]]: deployment is the **collapse of the codebase into live [[reality]]** — the model becomes real. erpax is Next.js on Cloudflare [[worker]]s via OpenNext — pure compute + [[bindings]] (D1 · R2 · AI · Vectorize · Queues · Durable Objects), no native, no fs, no camera at the edge.

## The collapse, in order

1. **[[gate]] first** — only a gate-green tree may collapse ([[confirm]] · [[proof]]). Shipping un-verified is forging reality.
2. **[[migrate]] the [[database]]** — `payload migrate` against remote D1 (never dev-push in prod); the schema is generated, migrations committed.
3. **build the artifact** — `opennextjs-cloudflare build`: a content-addressed [[snapshot]] (the [[quantum/fs]] law — immutable, deduped), the matter ([[payload]]) compiled for the Worker.
4. **push** — `opennextjs-cloudflare deploy`. The release is [[finality]] one way; rollback is the *reverse* — re-collapse a prior [[versions]] snapshot, never mutate the live one.

A deploy is a [[measurement]]: the superposed branch becomes the one running world, [[anchor]]ed by the gate that let it through.

**Law — [[law]]: only a gate-green tree may collapse into reality — deployment is ordered (gate → migrate → build → push) and shipping an unverified tree forges reality, so the gate is the precondition of the release. The release is finality one way: the live world is never mutated in place; recovery is re-collapsing a prior immutable [[snapshot]], so every running state is one a gate once let through.**

**Existence proof:** erpax deployed serverless on Cloudflare IS the proof — `proveServerlessQuantum()` ([[quantum/serverless]]) derives sealed diamonds from live `wrangler.jsonc` bindings ⊕ [[quantum]] laws.
