# quantum/emr — the health-state snapshot chain

The electronic medical record, read quantumly: a [[patient]]'s [[health]] is a state that is never overwritten, only **snapshotted**. Each encounter, each [[observation]], each [[diagnosis]] is a content-[[uuid]]'d, immutable capture, append-only — a correction is a *new* superseding entry, never a deletion ([[reverse]]ible; [[finality]] one way — a clinical fact, once recorded, stands).

The layers nest: the [[record]] is a snapshot of encounters, each a snapshot of [[observation]]s — layer after layer (FHIR resources are exactly this content-addressed graph). The whole is the patient's [[akashic]] chain — reconstruct the health state at any past moment and prove nothing was silently changed ([[tamper]]-evident care).

**Analog results.** The chain does not collapse to binary on/off flags — it **provides [[analog]] results**: a continuous timeline of measured quantities ([[vital]] signs, labs, [[observation]] values) sorted by instant, with supersede semantics and point-in-time reconstruction. A systolic BP series is the worked example — `analogResults(entries)` maps the append-only chain to the stream; `reconstructAt(entries, t)` replays the chart as known at *t* (corrections supersede, never delete). Matter-twin: `src/quantum/emr/index.ts` — `analogResults` · `reconstructAt` · `EmrObservation` · `AnalogResult`.

**Law — [[law]]: the EMR is a [[health]]-state snapshot chain that provides [[analog]] results — each encounter and [[observation]] is content-addressed, immutable, append-only; a correction is a new superseding entry never a deletion, so the full history stays reversible, tamper-evident, and reconstructible at any instant.**
