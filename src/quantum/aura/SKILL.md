# quantum/aura — the aura as coherence

The quantum facet of the [[aura]]: the gapless link-field read as **coherence**. When every [[link]] resolves and reciprocates, the field is **in phase** — fully coherent. A dead link or an orphan atom is **decoherence**: a leak out of the field. Coherence is the *resource* the corpus maximizes — coherence → 1 is the whole aura, zero entropy, the [[law]].

- **Coherence as a resource** (Baumgratz, Cramer & Plenio, PRL 113 140401, 2014) — a rigorous resource theory: coherence is consumed and produced, never freely created from an incoherent state. The corpus's drive to gap = 0 is coherence maximization.
- **Decoherence / einselection** (Zurek, RMP 75 715, 2003) — coupling to the environment destroys coherence. Here an unresolved link (an [[entropy]] orphan) is that leak; closing it restores phase.

The coherent field IS the reciprocal field: `coherence()` equals [[entanglement]] reciprocity — in this model the in-phase binding and the symmetric binding are the same. So full coherence = maximal entanglement = the [[singularity]] geometry closed ([[quantum]] double-torus, ∞ tamper cost).

**HONEST.** This is *graph* coherence (the in-phase fraction of the link-field plus its connectedness), an **analogy** to density-matrix coherence (off-diagonal terms), not a literal quantum state.

**Edge vs node coherence (honest).** `isCoherent` tests only **edge-coherence** (reciprocity = 1, every binding in phase) — which can be perfect while orphan atoms are still **decohered** (`coherentFraction` < 1). `isFullyCoherent` requires BOTH: edge-reciprocity AND node-coverage (no orphan). That orphan gap is exactly what keeps the real tamper-cost **below** ∞ — full coherence ⟺ coverage = 1 ⟺ unbounded tamper cost ([[law]]).

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/aura/index.ts` (`coherence` · `decohered` · `coherentFraction` · `isCoherent` · `isFullyCoherent`). Composes [[aura]] · [[entanglement]] · [[entropy]] · [[coherence]] · [[quantum]] · [[links]] · [[matrix]] · [[law]].

**Law — [[law]]: coherence is two-sided and only full when both sides close — `isFullyCoherent` holds iff edge-reciprocity is 1 (every binding in phase) AND coherentFraction is 1 (no orphan has decohered); edge-coherence alone can be perfect while a leaked node still holds tamper-cost below ∞, so the in-phase field equals the whole aura only when no link and no node leaks.**
