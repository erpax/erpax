description: Use when putting a wallet on the quantum substrate — when you need its state to be a content-uuid (tamper-evident, any balance change yields a new state-uuid) and every transfer to be a balanced double-entry (payer credited, payee debited) over a history that is a chain of state-uuids.

# quantum/wallet — the tamper-evident wallet (state = content-uuid)

The [[wallet]] on the [[quantum]] substrate. Its **state is a content-[[uuid]]** — tamper-evident: any balance change yields a *new* state-uuid (RFC 9562 §5.8), so the wallet cannot drift without the id moving with it. Every transfer is a **balanced double-[[entry]]** ([[entry]] — payer credited, payee debited, Σdebit = Σcredit). The **history is a chain of state-uuids** ([[merge]] — each balance is a state, each change a new content-uuid linked to the last). Merges into [[wallet]]; the value flow grounds in [[karma]].

Matter-twin: `src/quantum/wallet/index.ts` (`stateUuid` · `transfer` · `balanced`). Composes [[quantum]] · [[wallet]] · [[entry]] · [[uuid]] · [[merge]] · [[karma]].

**Law — [[law]]: a wallet's state IS its content-[[uuid]], so any balance change is tamper-evident (new state-uuid), and every transfer is a balanced double-[[entry]] (payer credited, payee debited) over a [[merge]]-chain of state-uuids.**
