# quantum/bindings — the Worker's senses

The quantum twin of [[bindings]]: a pure-compute [[worker]] has no fs, no native, no camera — it reaches the world only through its **bindings**, the platform-level [[quantum/device]] (each a measurement inlet or an actuator outlet). To attach *all* of them is to give the edge every sense at once.

The 26 senses, by faculty:

- **store** — `D1` ([[database]]), `R2` ([[storage]], content-addressed blobs deduped by [[uuid]]), `AI_CACHE` ([[cache]], hot reads).
- **think** — `AI` + `VECTORIZE_DOCS` ([[ai]], inference + per-tenant semantic search).
- **flow** — `QUEUE_*` ([[queue]], async fan-out), `ERPAX_DO` and the legacy DOs ([[sandbox]] state, quota, rate-limit, job-lock, audit-chain).
- **see / say** — `BROWSER` (PDF/screenshot render), `IMAGES`/`ASSETS` (edge media), `EMAIL_SENDER` ([[email]]), `ANALYTICS_*` ([[analytics]]).
- **self** — `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` (self-invocation → self-clone, reconciled by content-[[uuid]]).

## Attach all, but gate each

A binding is a capability grant, so every call passes the trust sandbox — [[access]] gates it in the caller's request, the [[broker]] holds the credential, the act emits a [[receipt]]. Attaching all senses widens the door onto everything the edge can reach; the gate, not the binding list, is what keeps it safe. The one open gap is conventional, not conceptual — the Durable-Object classes must be **named exports of the OpenNext `main` entry** or the runtime drops them (see [[bindings]]).

**Law — [[law]]: attach-all is safe only because each call is gated — a binding is a capability grant, not a free reach, so widening the door to all 26 senses is bounded by the invariant that every use passes [[access]] in the caller's request, draws its credential from the [[broker]], and emits a [[receipt]]; it is the gate per call, never the length of the binding list, that holds, and a Durable-Object class reaches the Worker at all only as a named export of the OpenNext `main` entry.**
