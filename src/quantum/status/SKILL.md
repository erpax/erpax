# status — the entry point a reference scan cannot see

This atom was a loose `.ts` beside the quantum barrel, and it nearly got deleted as dead code.

Two live commands dispatch it — `pnpm erpax quantum` and `pnpm erpax quantum status` — but the registry invokes it as a **subprocess path** (`tsx src/quantum/status.ts`), never as an import. So an import-path scan found zero references, a symbol scan for `runQuantumStatus` found zero references, and both were correct: nothing in the corpus *imports* it. Removing it would have broken two working commands while every lexical instrument reported it unused.

[[rules]]/unfolded states this limit in its own honest boundary — a dynamically-reached symbol is invisible to a lexical scan. Here the dynamic reach is a shell string, one level further out than a computed property.

## The guard that follows from it

The useful invariant is not *"is this symbol referenced"* — that question is unanswerable for a path dispatch. It is **"does every path the CLI dispatches actually exist"**, and that is decidable: parse each `cmd` in the registry for `src/…` targets and assert the file is there. A command whose target is missing is a command that cannot run, and nothing else in the tree would report it.

The test pins both directions: every quantum dispatch target resolves, and the two `status` commands point at this atom rather than at the loose sibling it replaced.

**Honest boundary.** This proves a dispatched path **exists**, never that the command **works** — a target that resolves can still fail at runtime, and the registry's non-`src` commands (`pnpm`, `bash`) are not checked here. It closes the deletion hazard, not the correctness question.

**Law — [[law]]: an entry point reached by path is invisible to every reference scan, so its existence must be asserted where the dispatch is declared — a target that no longer resolves is a command that silently stopped being one.**

## Standards

- **ISO/IEC 25010:2023 §5.5** — analysability: an entry point must be locatable from its declaration.
