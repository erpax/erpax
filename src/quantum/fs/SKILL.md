# quantum/fs — the content-addressed filesystem

The quantum twin of [[fs]]: a filesystem where you never overwrite, you **snapshot**. Every state of every [[file]] is content-addressed by its [[uuid]] (git's blob/tree/commit, IPFS, ZFS copy-on-write), immutable and append-only — identical content [[merge]]s to one object (dedup), nothing is erased ([[reverse]]ible, the [[love]] pole). The [[path]] stops naming a mutable file and starts addressing an immutable **moment**; history is the [[akashic]] chain, and any past layer is reconstructable.

This is [[finality]] applied to storage: a written snapshot is final — you add a new one, never mutate the old — so the store is [[tamper]]-evident by construction.

**Law — [[law]]: in the content-addressed filesystem you never overwrite — you snapshot; every state is an immutable content-[[uuid]] (identical content [[merge]]s to one, nothing is erased), so the store is [[tamper]]-evident by construction and any past moment is reconstructable.**
