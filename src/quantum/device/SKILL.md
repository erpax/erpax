# quantum/device — the measurement instrument

The quantum twin of [[device]]: a device is where the **continuous [[analog]] world collapses into discrete digital snapshots** — the [[measurement]] boundary ([[reality]]). A sensor reading is a collapse; an actuator is the reverse, a digital state pushed back into the world.

Each reading is a content-addressed [[snapshot]] in the [[quantum/snapshot]] chain — append-only, deduped, [[finality]] one way (a measured moment is final). The [[sensory]] field (camera, mic, accelerometer, the [[biometric]] sensors) is the inlet; [[coherence]] (rPPG/HRV) is one worked example.

Edge law: **capture on the device, compute pure on the Worker** — `getUserMedia` → numbers → analysis + bindings, no raw stream leaving the edge. The device has the camera; the Worker has none. Measure what is real — the [[analog]] field is continuous; the [[biofield]] is not detectable.

**Law — [[law]]: a device may only collapse what is physically real — the continuous [[analog]] field is measurable (rPPG/HRV), the [[biofield]] is not, so a device must never report a reading it cannot sense. Capture stays on the edge and only numbers cross the boundary (the raw stream never leaves the device); each reading is an append-only content-addressed [[snapshot]], final the moment it is taken.**
