description: Use when reasoning about quantum computed export — each file's public facet (index.ts symbols, SKILL atom name) derived from source, content-addressed; the producer dual of quantum import.

# quantum/export — quantum **computed** export

The quantum twin of [[exported]] ([[convention]]/exported): **export is what this file/diamond exposes to the lattice** — the `index.ts` re-exports (code facet), the SKILL.md atom name (form facet), the test surface.

**Computed, never authored:** `parseTsExports` derives named/`default`/`export *` symbols from TS; SKILL export = frontmatter `name:` or folder leaf. The boundary organ hashes `{ filePath, imports, exports }` into `boundaryUuid` — same bytes ⇒ same address; change one export ⇒ boundary flips.

An importer can entangle at `@/x` only if this atom **exports** through its index what is consumed ([[duality]] with quantum import).

Composes [[quantum/boundary]] · [[convention]]/exported · [[tamper]]/import · [[entanglement]].

**Law — [[law]]: quantum computed export — the public facet is algorithmically derived from source and content-addressed; every cross-atom symbol must be reachable from the atom's index barrel.**

@audit export set = parseTsExports / skillExportName — computed live
@standard an atom's only public code-face is index.ts
