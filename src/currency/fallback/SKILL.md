# currency/fallback — the blank currency as identity element

Every category that admits a "missing" value defines that missing case as a first-class typed entity. For [[currency]], ISO 4217 already did the work — code `XXX` (numeric 999, "No currency"). `resolveCurrency(code)` normalises `null` / `undefined` / `''` / whitespace / unknown to `XXX`, so imports without a currency column don't reject, foreign-key joins don't dangle, and money math degenerates cleanly (XXX has 0 decimals, no symbol). The blank currency is **universal**: `currenciesCompatible('EUR', 'XXX')` is true, and any conversion touching XXX short-circuits to the identity rate (`1.0`, `source: 'identity'`) — `realtimeRate` / `convertMoney` / `aggregateBalancesAcrossCurrencies` never throw; a down provider degrades to identity rather than failing. This is Conservation [[law]] 53 self-referential closure at the value level: when the external source is unreachable, the system answers itself with the identity element.

Matter-twin: `src/currency/fallback/index.ts` (`resolveCurrency` ⊕ `BLANK_CURRENCY` · `currenciesCompatible` · `currencyDecimals` · `realtimeRate` · `convertMoney` · `aggregateBalancesAcrossCurrencies`, each quote carrying a provenance [[uuid]]). Composes [[currency]] · [[law]] · [[uuid]] · [[balance]].

**Law — [[law]]: the blank [[currency]] XXX is the identity element of the currency category — every missing/blank/unknown value resolves to it, it is compatible with every code, and every conversion touching it degrades to the identity rate so the platform never crashes on a missing currency.**
