description: Use when closing a multi-currency period — verify each currency's closed revenues equal its closed expenses within tolerance, revalue non-reporting currencies at the period-end rate for unrealized gain/loss, and fold it all into one reporting currency with a chain-linked audit leaf.

# currency/reconciliation — multi-currency period closing

Period closing across currencies is one balanced fold. `validateClosingBalanceByCurrency` checks, per [[currency]], that closed revenues equal closed expenses within a rounding tolerance (default `0.01`) — the difference is the imbalance, `isBalanced` the verdict. `computeUnrealizedExchangeGainLoss` revalues a net amount at the period-end rate against its historical rate; the gap is the unrealized FX gain/loss (IAS 21 §38 / IFRS 9). `reconcileMultiCurrency` composes the two: it validates every currency, skips the reporting currency (no revaluation of self), records a missing-rate error rather than crashing, sums the unrealized lines, and seals the result with a `chainLeafUuid` (Conservation [[law]] 60) so the close is replay-verifiable. Every method is pure — no mutation, JSON-serializable in and out.

Matter-twin: `src/currency/reconciliation/index.ts` (`CurrencyReconciliation` static class — `validateClosingBalanceByCurrency` ⊕ `computeUnrealizedExchangeGainLoss` · `reconcileMultiCurrency` · `validateCurrencyCode` · `computeChainLeaf`). Composes [[currency]] · [[law]] · [[balance]] · [[uuid]] · [[proof]].

**Law — [[law]]: a multi-[[currency]] close balances per currency within tolerance, revalues every non-reporting currency at the period-end rate for unrealized gain/loss, and folds into the reporting currency under a chain-linked [[uuid]] leaf (Law 60) — pure, missing rates recorded as errors, never thrown.**
