# standard/collection/hook — one spine, so no collection can forget a leg of it

Every accountable collection needs the same three things: its tenant filled in before validation, its
author recorded on change, and its audit entry written after. Declared per collection, that is 231
opportunities to omit one — and the omission is silent, because a document without an audit entry
looks exactly like a document with one until somebody goes looking.

So the triple is a **factory**, not a convention. A collection composes extra hooks around the spine
through `opts`, and the audit hook is appended **last** by construction — not by asking authors to
remember, but because it must observe the final state, after every other hook has had its say. A
hook order that a human maintains is a hook order that drifts.

**Honest boundary.** This guarantees the spine is *present and ordered* wherever the factory is used.
It cannot make a collection use the factory — that is [[rules]]' territory, and a hand-rolled
collection bypasses this entirely. It also does not verify the audit chain's own integrity, which
[[audit]] owns.

**Law — [[law]]: a lifecycle every collection shares is defined once and composed, never restated.
Ordering that matters is enforced by construction, because a rule about ordering that lives in prose
is obeyed until the first hurry.**

## Standards

- **ISO 19011:2018** — audit trail.
- **ISO/IEC 27001 A.5.23** — tenant isolation via the tenant field.
- **SOX §404** — internal controls: provenance.

Composes: [[standard]] · [[audit]] · [[law]].
