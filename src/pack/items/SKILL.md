# pack/items — the pack line

One pack line is the units of one produced [[lot/variants|lot-variant]] packed into one [[packs|pack]] — the entry the carton's `unitsPacked` total rolls up from. Evolved from 200,993 rows of etrima `pack_items`.

**Header-primary, options optional.** AUDIT: the header `unitsPacked` carries the quantity on 99.92% of rows; the 12 fixed `option_N` slots are used on only 0.17%. So `options[]` is an OPTIONAL fine-grained breakdown ([[field|discriminator]] — many columns ⇒ one array). `rollUpOptions` (beforeChange) enforces the law: **options present ⇒ header = Σ options** (the double-entry held at 100.0000% in the data); options absent ⇒ the recorded header stands. Always `unitsBackordered = max(0, ordered − packed)` — the unpacked remainder ([[balance]]).

**The cross is `pack` ⊕ `lotVariant`, both real relationships** now those collections are minted. AUDIT dropped the DEAD `item_id` (NULL in 100% of rows): the line does not point at the catalog item — it points at the produced [[lot/variants|lot-variant]] (0% null). Per-option grams (`unitGrams` / `netUnitGrams`) ride the option line for the rare weighed breakdown, feeding the [[packs|pack]] mass balance.

Matter-twin: `src/pack/items/index.ts`. Composes [[packs]] · [[lot/variants]] · [[balance]] · [[field|discriminator]] · [[coordinate]] · [[accounting]].

**Law — [[law]]: a pack line is the units of one produced [[lot/variants|lot-variant]] packed into one [[packs|pack]] — header-primary with an optional option breakdown whose double-entry holds when supplied (options present ⇒ header = Σ options; `unitsBackordered = max(0, ordered − packed)`).**
