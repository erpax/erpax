description: Use when a tax-ID needs a normalised type-label stamped onto the document — a beforeChange hook that matches the raw number against the per-country regex registry so downstream code branches on a label, not a free-form match.

# classify/tax/id — stamp the tax-ID's type-label

A beforeChange hook-factory that reads a document's tax-ID and [[country]] (by dotted path, defaulting to the canonical top-level layout, or nested `tax.vatNumber` for Customers/Vendors) and writes back a normalised type-label — `"EIK / Bulstat"`, `"VAT (BG)"`, `"EIN"`, `"GSTIN"` — drawn from the per-country format registry. The point: downstream code branches on a stable label instead of re-running country regexes. No match (or non-string input) is a clean no-op — the document passes through untouched and unlabelled.

Matter-twin: `src/classify/tax/id/index.ts` (`classifyTaxId` hook-factory over `country-specifics`' `classifyTaxId(country, value)`). Composes [[tax]] · [[id]] · [[country]].

**Law — [[law]]: the type-label is derived once, at write time, from the [[country]] registry — so downstream branches on a normalised label, never a free-form regex; an unrecognised id leaves the document untouched (no false label).**
