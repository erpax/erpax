# trust — the segregated client account (a balance invariant on the ledger)

A **trust** (IOLTA) account holds client money the firm may not touch except to bill against fees already earned. Strip the prefix and it is a segregated sub-account on the one [[accounting]] ledger, governed by a [[balance]] invariant: client funds are a liability the firm owes, every draw posts a double [[entry]] (trust → operating *only* against an issued invoice), and a per-client trust ledger may never go negative or be commingled — the conservation law ([[balance]]: Σ = 0, nothing escapes) applied to fiduciary money. A draw is a [[transaction]] gated by the [[matter]]'s billed work ([[allocation]]). A violation surfaces immediately as an unbalanced ledger (the gate — [[proof]]). Composes [[accounting]] · [[balance]] · [[entry]] · [[transaction]] · [[matter]] · [[allocation]].

**Law — [[law]]: a trust account is a segregated sub-account on the one double-entry ledger — client funds are a liability, every draw is a double [[entry]] against billed work, and the per-client trust ledger may never go negative or commingle ([[balance]]).**
